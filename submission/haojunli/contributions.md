### Methodology Brainstorming
- Together proposed the baseline model with a default RAG pipeline. Listing the data collection and annotation process. Proposing alternative pipeline component and corresponding models. xxx

### Data Collection
- Qingyang Liu: Collected urls w.r.t music and future events.
- Chenglin Zhang: Collected urls w.r.t general history and history. Also collected some subplemented resources.
- Haojun Liu: Collected urls w.r.t culture and sports.

### Data Annotation
- Qingyang Liu: Built up the annotation pipeline, conducted prompt engineering and finally output the Q&A pairs
- Chenglin Zhang: Finalized the web sracpping pipeline and conducted the scrapping process.
- Haojun Liu: Implemented a draft pipeline for web scrapping.

### RAG Pipeline
- Qingyang Liu: Implemented the Rerank and Hypocritical Document Generator components. Help implement the dafault RAG pipeline and scripts.
- Haojun Liu: Implemented the default RAG pipeline and scripts.

### Experiments
- Qingyang Liu: Conducted experiments for text splitter, the rerank model and the hypo-doc-gen model (related hyperparameters).
- Chenglin Zhang: Conducted experiments for the default pipeline and provided technical support.
- Haojun Liu: Conducted experiments for embedding models, Retriever (related Hyperparameters), and sublink-file cases.

### Graphing
- Qingyang Liu: Generated graphs for retrieval performance.
- Chenglin Zhang: Created visualizations for generation and reranking metrics.
- Haojun Liu: Graphs related to is_future_event attribute.

### Report Writing
