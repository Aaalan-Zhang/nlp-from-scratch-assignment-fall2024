than 40 between 1997 and 1999 . [ 92 ] ACHD spokesman Guillermo Cole stated `` It 's the best it 's been in the lifetime for virtually every resident in this county ... We 've seen a steady decrease in pollution levels over the past decade and certainly over the past 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 years , or more . '' [ 93 ] As of 2005 , the city includes 31,000 trees on 900 miles of streets . A 2011 analysis of Pittsburgh 's tree cover , which involved sampling more than 200 small plots throughout the city , showed a value of between $ 10 and $ 13 million in annual benefits based on the urban forest contributions to aesthetics , energy use and air quality . Energy savings from shade , impact on city air and water quality , and the boost in property values were taken into account in the analysis . The city spends $ 850,000 annually on street tree planting and maintenance . [ 94 ] Despite improvements , some studies still suggest that poor air quality in Pittsburgh is causing negative health effects . In a past study conducted between 2014 and 2016 researchers determined that children who lived in areas close to sources of pollution , such as industrial sites , experienced rates of asthma at almost 3 times the national average . [ 95 ] The study also found that 38 % of students live in areas over USEPA 's 12 micrograms per cubic meter standards , while 70 % live in areas over the WHO 's standard of 10 micrograms per cubic meter . [ 95 ] Several of the plants were located in or very near Pittsburgh . [ 95 ] The study also noted that most of the effected communities were minority communities . [ 95 ] This had led some residents in Pittsburgh to believe that the continuing effects of air pollution are a case of environmental racism . [ 96 ] Groups such as Women for a Healthy Environment are working to address ongoing concerns surrounding air pollution in Pittsburgh . [ 97 ] WHE does work such as policy analysis , publishing reports , and community education . [ 97 ] In the summer of 2017 , a crowd sourced air quality monitoring application , Smell PGH , was launched . As air quality is still a concern of many in the area , the app allows for users to report odd smells and informs local authorities . [ 98 ] Water quality [ edit ] The local rivers continue to have pollution levels exceeding EPA limits . [ 99 ] This is caused by frequently overflowing untreated sewage into local waterways , due to flood conditions and antiquated infrastructure . Pittsburgh has a combined sewer system , where its sewage pipes contain both stormwater and wastewater . The pipes were constructed in the early 1900s , and the sewage treatment plant was built in 1959 . [ 100 ] Due to insufficient improvements over time , the city is faced with public health concerns regarding its water . [ 101 ] As little as a tenth of an inch of rain causes runoffs from the sewage system to drain into local rivers . [ 102 ] Nine billion gallons of untreated waste and stormwater flow into rivers , leading to health hazards and Clean Water Act violations . [ 103 ] The local sewage authority , Allegheny County Sanitary Authority , or ALCOSAN , is operating under Consent Decree from the EPA to come up with solutions . [ 104 ] In 2017 , ALCOSAN proposed a $ 2 billion upgrade to the system which was approved by the EPA in 2019 . [ 105 ] [ 106 ] Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority ( PWSA ) is the city 's agency required to replace pipes and charge water rates . They have come under fire from both city and state authorities due to alleged mismanagement . [ 107 ] In 2017 , Mayor William Peduto advocated for a restructuring of the PWSA and a partially privatized water authority . [ 108 ] Governor Wolf subsequently assigned the PWSA to be under the oversight of the Public Utilities Commission ( PUC ) . [ 107 ] PWSA has also been subject to criticism due to findings released in 2016 showing high levels of lead in Pittsburgh 's drinking water . [ 109 ] Although Pittsburgh 's drinking water had been high in lead levels , and steadily rising , for many years , many residents blame PWSA administrative changes for the spike in lead levels . [ 110 ] In the years prior , PWSA had hired Veolia , a Paris-based company , for consultation to help with mounting administrative difficulties . [ 111 ] By 2015 , PWSA in consultation with Veolia had laid off 23 people , including halving the laboratory staff that was responsible for testing water safety and quality . [ 111 ] Simultaneously , PWSA in consultation with Veolia had changed what chemicals they were using to prevent metal corrosion in 2014 , [ 110 ] from soda ash to caustic soda , without consulting with Department of Environmental Protection . [ 112 ] Anti-corrosive chemicals were being used because many of Pittsburgh 's water pipes were made of lead , and adding anti-corrosive chemicals helped prevent lead from seeping into drinking water . [ 112 ] In 2016 lead levels were as high as 27 ppb in some cases . The legal limit is 15 ppb , although there is not a safe amount of lead in drinking water . [ 112 ] Though lead levels had been rising in previous years , they had not exceeded the legal limit . [ 110 ] In late 2015 PWSA terminated its contracted with Veolia . [ 111 ] In response to the high lead levels PWSA began adding orthophosphate to the water . [ 113 ] Orthophosphate is meant to create a coating on the inside of pipes , creating a barrier to prevent lead from leaching into drinking water . [ 113 ] PWSA has also been working to replace lead pipes , and continuing to test water for lead . [ 113 ] There remains concern among residents over the long-term effects of this lead , particularly for children , in whom lead causes permanent damage to the brain and nervous system . [ 114 ] Some people also believe that the high
