Summers are hot and winters are moderately cold with wide variations in temperature . Despite this , it has one of the most pleasant summer climates between medium and large cities in the U.S. [ 71 ] [ 72 ] [ 73 ] The city lies in the USDA plant hardiness zone 6b except along the rivers where the zone is 7a . [ 74 ] The area has four distinct seasons : winters are cold and snowy , springs and falls are mild with moderate levels of sunshine , and summers are warm . As measured by percent possible sunshine , summer is by far the sunniest season , though annual sunshine is low among major US cities at well under 50 % . [ 75 ] The warmest month of the year in Pittsburgh is July , with a 24-hour average of 73.2 °F ( 22.9 °C ) . Conditions are often humid , and combined with highs reaching 90 °F ( 32 °C ) on an average 9.5 days a year , [ 76 ] a considerable heat index arises . The coolest month is January , when the 24-hour average is 28.8 °F ( −1.8 °C ) , and lows of 0 °F ( −18 °C ) or below can be expected on an average 2.6 nights per year . [ 76 ] Officially , record temperatures range from −22 °F ( −30 °C ) , on January 19 , 1994 to 103 °F ( 39 °C ) , which occurred three times , most recently on July 16 , 1988 ; the record cold daily maximum is −3 °F ( −19 °C ) , which occurred three times , most recently the day of the all-time record low , while , conversely , the record warm daily minimum is 82 °F ( 28 °C ) on July 1 , 1901 . [ 76 ] [ b ] Due to elevation and location on the windward side of the Appalachian Mountains , 100 °F ( 38 °C ) + readings are very rare , and were last seen on July 15 , 1995 . [ 76 ] Average annual precipitation is 39.61 inches ( 1,006 mm ) and precipitation is greatest in May while least in October ; annual precipitation has historically ranged from 22.65 in ( 575 mm ) in 1930 to 57.83 in ( 1,469 mm ) in 2018 . [ 77 ] On average , December and January have the greatest number of precipitation days . Snowfall averages 44.1 inches ( 112 cm ) per season , but has historically ranged from 8.8 in ( 22 cm ) in 1918–19 to 80 in ( 200 cm ) in 1950–51 . [ 78 ] There is an average of 59 clear days and 103 partly cloudy days per year , while 203 days are cloudy . [ 79 ] In terms of annual percent-average possible sunshine received , Pittsburgh ( 45 % ) is similar to Seattle ( 49 % ) .
