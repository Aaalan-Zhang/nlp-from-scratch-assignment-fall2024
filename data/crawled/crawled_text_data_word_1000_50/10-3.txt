in the nation , but the world . For many years , the multiple rail crossings in the suburb of Port Perry at the mouth of Turtle Creek on the Monongahela River and adjacent to the Edgar Thomson Works and Duquesne mills , was the highest concentration of freight traffic in the world . Even today , with river traffic included , Port Perry is often very near or at the top of the list . The Conway Yard to the west of the city along the Ohio River was the largest rail yard in the world from 1956 until 1980 . From the beginning of the industrial era in America through its collapse in the 1980s , Pittsburgh was a key market for the nation 's largest and most important railroads ( most notably the Pennsylvania Railroad [ the largest company in the world for much of the 20th century ] , and the New York Central Railroad [ via the Pittsburgh & Lake Erie ] , Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and Pittsburgh & West Virginia ) . Despite the near-complete collapse of heavy industry in the Northeast , Pittsburgh remains an extremely important link in the nation 's rail network . Current railroads in Pittsburgh include : Class I railroads [ edit ] Norfolk Southern ( NS ) [ edit ] Norfolk Southern operates the former assets of Conrail , composed of the Pennsylvania Railroad , instrumental in the formation of modern Pittsburgh . NS operates three lines through Pittsburgh : the original line , the Pittsburgh Line , from U.S. Steel 's Edgar Thomson Steel Mill in Braddock , PA , over the Allegheny River near Downtown Pittsburgh , into Island Ave Yard where it becomes the Fort Wayne Line ; the Mon Line , along the south bank of the Monongahela River from West Brownsville , PA , to Island Ave Yard , formerly the Pittsburgh , Virginia and Charleston Railroad . This line is used by coal trains from southern Pennsylvania and trains with over-height cars that can not fit under the roof of Penn Station on the Pittsburgh Line , accessing it via a branch just east of Braddock to the Port Perry bridge . The Mon Line joins the Fort Wayne Line at Island Ave Yard after crossing the Ohio River on the Ohio Connecting ( OC ) Railroad bridge ; the Conemaugh Line , along the north shore of the Allegheny River , serving several coal branch lines and power plants . Operations are centered on a small yard in Etna , PA. On the Mon and Pittsburgh lines over 60 trains a day pass through the city . CSX [ edit ] CSX operates the former Baltimore and Ohio Railroad ( B & O ) and the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad ( P & LE ) . Many of the old B & O lines have been removed or are unused . Formerly an important part of the B & O system , Glenwood Yard is leased and operated by the Allegheny Valley Railroad for local jobs . The yard used to give access to the B & O 's Grant Street Station in Downtown Pittsburgh . The building has been rebuilt into a PNC Bank building and the old right-of-way is now a bike path . The B & O main line , which cuts north and under across Pittsburgh by the Schenley Tunnel , is now used by the AVR . The 33rd Street Railroad Bridge over the Allegheny River is still used : AVR trains connect with Norfolk Southern 's Pittsburgh Line about a mile east of Penn Station . CSX freight trains use the former P & LE through McKeesport , PA , and Braddock , PA , before crossing the Mononghela River into Homestead , PA . The P & LE line and the Mon Line run side by side until the Mon Line crosses the Ohio Connecting Railroad Bridge at McKees Rocks , Pennsylvania . On an average day , the P & LE line carries about 30–35 trains . Class II railroads [ edit ] Wheeling & Lake Erie [ edit ] The Wheeling & Lake Erie is a regional railroad incorporated in 1990 after the Norfolk and Western Railway sold trackage from the original Wheeling & Lake Erie Railroad . Wheeling and Lake Erie R.R . Bessemer & Lake Erie [ edit ] The Bessemer & Lake Erie Railroad runs north from the North Bessemer Yard in Penn Hills to Conneaut , Ohio . In 2004 , the B & LE was purchased by Canadian National Railway . Class III railroads [ edit ] Allegheny Valley Railroad [ edit ] The Allegheny Valley Railroad runs mostly on former Pennsylvania Railroad and Baltimore and Ohio Railroad lines . AVR ( Allegheny Valley Railroad ) Pittsburgh and Ohio Central Railroad [ edit ] The Pittsburgh and Ohio Central Railroad operates former Pennsylvania Railroad trackage on the Chartiers Branch and the Panhandle Route to the southwest . Union Railroad [ edit ] Union Railroad mainly serves the last remaining steel mills in the city . It has interchanges with the B & LE at North Bessemer .
