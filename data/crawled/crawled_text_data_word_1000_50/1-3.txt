in the Royal Proclamation of 1763 the British authorities had decreed that there would be no British-American settlements west of the Alleghenies , but the authorities had been unable or unwilling to enforce these decrees ) led to the outbreak of Pontiac 's War . The Odawa leader Pontiac launched an offensive against British forts in May 1763 . Native American tribes from the Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes overran numerous British forts ; one of their most important targets was Fort Pitt . Receiving warning of the coming attack , Captain Simeon Ecuyer , the Swiss officer in command of the garrison , prepared for a siege . He leveled the houses outside the ramparts and ordered all settlers into the fort : 330 men , 104 women , and 196 children sought refuge inside its ramparts . [ 11 ] Captain Ecuyer also gathered stores , which included hundreds of barrels of pork and beef . Pontiac 's forces attacked the fort on June 22 , 1763 , and the siege of Fort Pitt lasted for two months . [ 15 ] Pontiac 's warriors kept up a continuous , though ineffective , fire on it from July 27 through August 1 , 1763 . [ 21 ] They drew off to confront the relieving party under Colonel Bouquet , which defeated them in the Battle of Bushy Run . [ 21 ] This victory ensured British dominion over the forks of the Ohio , if not the entire Ohio valley . In 1764 Colonel Bouquet added a redoubt , the Fort Pitt Blockhouse , which still stands , the sole remaining structure from Fort Pitt and the oldest authenticated building west of the Allegheny Mountains . [ 15 ] Fort Pitt , 1795 The Iroquois signed the Fort Stanwix Treaty of 1768 , ceding the lands south of the Ohio to the British Crown . [ 21 ] European expansion into the upper Ohio valley increased . An estimated 4,000 to 5,000 families settled in western Pennsylvania between 1768 and 1770 . Of these settlers , about a third were English-American , another third were Scotch-Irish , and the rest were Welsh , German and others . [ 23 ] These groups tended to settle together in small farming communities , but often their households were not within hailing distance . The life of a settler family was one of relentless hard work : clearing the forest , stumping the fields , building cabins and barns , planting , weeding , and harvesting . In addition , almost everything was manufactured by hand , including furniture , tools , candles , buttons , and needles . [ 23 ] Settlers had to deal with harsh winters , and with snakes , black bears , mountain lions , and timber wolves . Because of the fear of raids by Native Americans , the settlers often built their cabins near , or even on top of , springs , to ensure access to water . They also built blockhouses , where neighbors would rally during conflicts . [ 4 ] Increasing violence , especially by the Shawnee , Miami , and Wyandot tribes , led to Dunmore 's War in 1774 . Conflict with Native Americans continued throughout the Revolutionary War , as some hoped that the war would end with expulsion of the settlers from their territory . In 1777 , Fort Pitt became a United States fort , when Brigadier General Edward Hand took command . In 1779 , Colonel Daniel Brodhead led 600 men from Fort Pitt to destroy Seneca villages along the upper Allegheny . [ 4 ] With the war still ongoing , in 1780 Virginia and Pennsylvania came to an agreement on their mutual borders , creating the state lines known today and determining finally that the jurisdiction of Pittsburgh region was Pennsylvanian . In 1783 , the Revolutionary War ended , which also brought at least a temporary cessation of border warfare . In the 1784 Treaty of Fort Stanwix , the Iroquois ceded the land north of the Purchase Line to Pennsylvania . [ 4 ] Map of Pittsburgh in 1795 After the Revolution , the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow . One of its earliest industries was boat building . Flatboats could be used to carry large numbers of pioneers and goods downriver , while keelboats were capable of traveling upriver . [ 24 ] The village began to develop vital institutions . Hugh Henry Brackenridge , a Pittsburgh resident and state legislator , introduced a bill that resulted in a gift deed of land and a charter for the Pittsburgh Academy on February 28 , 1787 . The academy later developed as the University of Western Pennsylvania ( 1819 ) and since 1908 has been known as the University of Pittsburgh . [ 25 ] Many farmers distilled their corn harvest into whiskey , increasing its value while lowering its transportation costs . At that time , whiskey was used as a form of currency on the frontier . When the federal government imposed an excise tax on whiskey , Western Pennsylvania farmers felt victimized , leading to the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794 . Farmers from the region rallied at Braddock 's Field and marched on Pittsburgh . The short-lived rebellion was put down , however , when President George Washington sent in militias from several states . [ 20 ] The town continued to grow in manufacturing capability . In 1792 , the boatyards in Pittsburgh built a sloop , Western Experiment . [ 26 ] During the next decades , the yards produced other large boats . By the 19th century , they were building ocean-going vessels that shipped goods as far as Europe . In 1794 , the town 's first courthouse was built ; it was a wooden structure on Market Square . [ 11 ] In 1797 , the manufacture of glass began .

Pittsburgh was located in the middle of one of the most productive coalfields in the country ; the region was also rich in petroleum , natural gas ,
