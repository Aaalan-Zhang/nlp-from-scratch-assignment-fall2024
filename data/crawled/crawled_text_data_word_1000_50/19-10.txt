Chris Messina proposed vertical/associational grouping of messages , trends , and events on Twitter by the means of hashtags . Java – class-based object oriented programming language that was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems ( which has since been acquired by Oracle ) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems ' Java platform . Mach ( kernel ) – Richard Rashid and Avie Tevanian developed Mach at Carnegie Mellon from 1985 to 1994 , ending with Mach 3.0 , which is a true microkernel . Mach was developed as a replacement for the kernel in the BSD version of Unix , so no new operating system would have to be designed around it . Experimental research on Mach appears to have ended , although Mach and its derivatives exist within a number of commercial operating systems . These include NeXTSTEP and OPENSTEP , upon which macOS and iOS are based .

[ 155 ] Traditions [ edit ] Main article : Carnegie Mellon University traditions The Fence In the early days of Carnegie Tech , there was a single bridge connecting Margaret Morrison Women 's College with the Carnegie Institute of Technology . The bridge was a meeting place for students . In 1916 , the bridge was taken down and the university filled in the area . The administration built a wooden fence as a new meeting place . The students did not understand why anyone would want to meet at a fence . The administration was about to give up and tear it down , but that night a fraternity , as a prank , painted the entire fence advertising a fraternity party . Ever since , painting the Fence has been a Carnegie Mellon tradition . [ 156 ] The Fence at Carnegie Mellon lies at the center of campus , in the area known as `` the Cut '' . Students guard
