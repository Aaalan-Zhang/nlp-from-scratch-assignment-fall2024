[ 11 ] By this definition , the informal regional boundaries are similar to historical interpretations where the region is defined as the central portion of the Allegheny Plateau to the west and north of the Allegheny Front and south of Lake Erie and Pennsylvania 's Northern Tier . [ 12 ] The hills and river valleys along the Upper Ohio River and its many eastern tributaries , including the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers have historically been the major centers of population of the region . [ 12 ] According to this research the US can be divided into 'mega regions ' based on the most extreme commuting patterns within a geographical area ( commutes within 100 miles from the core city ) . By this liberal definition , the Pittsburgh mega region consists of twenty-eight Pennsylvania counties ( Allegheny , Armstrong , Beaver , Bedford , Blair , Butler , Cambria , Cameron , Centre , Clarion , Clearfield , Crawford , Elk , Erie , Fayette , Forest , Greene , Huntingdon , Indiana , Jefferson , Lawrence , Mercer , Mifflin , Somerset , Venango , Warren , Washington , and Westmoreland ) , nineteen West Virginia counties ( Barbour , Brooke , Doddridge , Grant , Hancock , Harrison , Lewis , Marion , Marshall , Mineral , Monongalia , Ohio , Preston , Randolph , Taylor , Tucker , Tyler , Upshur , and Wetzel ) , five Ohio counties ( Belmont , Columbiana , Harrison , Jefferson , and Monroe ) , and two Maryland counties ( Allegany and Garrett ) , and portions of Chautauqua , New York in and around Ripley . [ 11 ] The combined population of the megaregion was over 4.9 million in 2016 .
