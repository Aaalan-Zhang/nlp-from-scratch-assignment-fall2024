National League in the 1930s and 1940s . [ 39 ] 1930s [ edit ] Pittsburgh was a Republican stronghold starting in the 1880s , [ 64 ] and the Republican governments provided jobs and assistance for the new immigrants in return for their votes . But the Great Depression starting in 1929 ruined the GOP in the city . The Democratic victory of 1932 meant an end to Republican patronage jobs and assistance . As the Depression worsened , Pittsburgh ethnics voted heavily for the Democrats , especially in 1934 , making the city a stronghold of the New Deal Coalition . By 1936 , Democratic programs for relief and jobs , especially the WPA , were so popular with the ethnics that a large majority voted for the Democrats . [ 65 ] [ 66 ] Joseph Guffey , statewide leader of the Democrats , and his local lieutenant David Lawrence gained control of all federal patronage in Pittsburgh after Roosevelt 's landslide victory in 1932 and the election of a Democratic mayor in 1933 . Guffey and Lawrence used the New Deal programs to increase their political power and build up a Democratic machine that superseded the decaying Republican machine . Guffey acknowledged that a high rate of people on relief was not only `` a challenge '' but also `` an opportunity . '' He regarded each relief job as Democratic patronage . [ 67 ] 1940s [ edit ] Pittsburgh was at the center of the `` Arsenal of Democracy `` that provided steel , aluminum , munitions and machinery for the U.S. during World War II . Pittsburgh 's mills contributed 95 million tons of steel to the war effort . The increased production output created a workforce shortage , which resulted in African Americans moving en masse during the Second Great Migration from the South to the city in order to find work . [ 11 ] Postwar [ edit ] David Lawrence , a Democrat , served as mayor of Pittsburgh from 1946 to 1959 and as Pennsylvania 's governor from 1959 to 1963 . [ 68 ] Lawrence used his political power to transform Pittsburgh 's political machine into a modern governmental unit that could run the city well and honestly . [ 69 ] In 1946 Lawrence decided to enforce the Smoke Control Ordinance of 1941 because he believed smoke abatement was crucial for the city 's future economic development . However , enforcement placed a substantial burden on the city 's working-class because smoky bituminous coal was much less expensive than smokeless fuels . One round of protests came from Italian-American organizations , which called for delay in enforcing it . Enforcement raised their cost of living and threatened the jobs of their relatives in nearby bituminous coal mines . Despite dislike of the smoke abatement program , Italian Americans strongly supported the reelection of Lawrence in 1949 , in part because many of them were on the city payroll .

For the basketball team , see Pittsburgh Rens . The multi-purpose Three Rivers Stadium was built in 1970 as part of the Renaissance I project . It was imploded in 2001 . Rich and productive , Pittsburgh was also the `` Smoky City , '' with smog sometimes so thick that streetlights burned during the day [ 11 ] as well as rivers that resembled open sewers . Civic leaders , notably Mayor David L. Lawrence , elected in 1945 , Richard K. Mellon , chairman of Mellon Bank and John P. Robin [ 71 ] [ 72 ] began smoke control and urban revitalization , also known as Urban Renewal projects that transformed the city [ 11 ] in unforeseen ways . `` Renaissance I '' began in 1946 . Title One of the Housing Act of 1949 provided the means in which to begin . By 1950 , vast swaths of buildings and land near the Point were demolished for Gateway Center . 1953 saw the opening of the ( since demolished ) Greater Pittsburgh Municipal Airport terminal . [ 27 ] In the late 1950s and early 1960s , the lower Hill District , an area inhabited predominantly by poor Blacks , was completely destroyed . Ninety-five acres of the lower Hill District were cleared using eminent domain , forcibly displacing hundreds of small businesses and more than 8,000 people ( 1,239 black families , 312 white ) , to make room for a cultural center that included the Civic Arena , which opened in 1961 . [ 73 ] Other than one apartment building , none of the other buildings planned for the cultural center were ever built . In the early 1960s , the neighborhood of East Liberty was also included in Renaissance I Urban Renewal plans , with over 125 acres ( 0.51 km 2 ) of the neighborhood being demolished and replaced with garden apartments , three 20-story public housing apartments , and a convoluted road-way system that circled a pedestrianized shopping district . In the span of just a few years during the mid-1960s , East Liberty became a blighted neighborhood . There were some 575 businesses in East Liberty in 1959 , but only 292 in 1970 , and just 98 in 1979 . Preservation efforts by the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation , along with community neighborhood groups , resisted the demolition plans . The neighborhoods containing rich architectural heritage , including the Mexican War Streets , Allegheny West , and Manchester , were spared . The center of Allegheny City , with its culturally and socially important buildings , was not as lucky . All of the buildings , with the exception of the Old U.S. Post Office , the Carnegie Library , and Buhl Planetarium were destroyed and replaced with the `` pedestrianized '' Allegheny Center Mall and apartments . The city 's industrial base continued to grow in the post-war era [ 74 ] partly assisted by the area 's first agency entirely devoted to industrial development , the RIDC .
