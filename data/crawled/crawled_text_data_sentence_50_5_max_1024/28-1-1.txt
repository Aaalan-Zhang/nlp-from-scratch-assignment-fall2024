. In 1988 , Delta Upsilon [ 14 ] broke the course record with a time of 2:08.5 [ 15 ] – a record that stood only briefly as SPIRIT surpassed that time later that day and further lowered the record time the following day . Two wheeled buggies were later eliminated from competition for safety reasons through modifications to the rules . PiKA and SPIRIT took every Sweepstakes championship from 1986 until 2000 when SDC won the women 's race and 2001 when Fringe won the men 's race . PiKA continued its success in the 2000s , setting the consecutive wins record by winning for seven years in a row ( 2002–2008 ) . SDC took the title in the men 's race in 2009 breaking PiKA 's streak and setting a new record . Fringe took the men 's title in 2010 after a dominant SDC was removed from competition due to an alleged fire safety violation . Fringe took the men 's title again in 2011 in beating SDC A by 1 second , with SDC B and C teams taking 3rd and 4th , while SDC reclaimed the Women 's title . [ 16 ] The defending men 's champion is SDC with eight consecutive wins from 2012 through 2019 , which is the record for most wins in a row . The current women 's title is also held by SDC ( 2017 , 2018 and 2019 ) . Live media coverage of the Sweepstakes races has historically been provided by WRCT-FM , the school 's student-run radio station . In recent years , campus television station cmuTV has broadcast live video coverage of the races with commentary from WRCT-FM . In the fall of 2008 the Buggy Alumni Association [ 17 ] was founded to preserve the history of the sport , assist with keeping alumni connected to the event and assist the current students in maintaining the race 's continuing existence . The race videos are available on DVD from cmuTV after the races end .
