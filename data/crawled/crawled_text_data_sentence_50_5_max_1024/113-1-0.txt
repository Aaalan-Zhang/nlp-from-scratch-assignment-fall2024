[ 18 ] Ilkin would eventually serve as a de facto replacement for Cope following Cope 's retirement . Catchphrases and nicknames [ edit ] Like other sports announcers in Pittsburgh , particularly Penguins commentator Mike Lange and the late Pirates announcer Bob Prince , Cope had a repertoire of unique catchphrases employed in his broadcasts , such as `` Mmm-Hah ! '' ( when he loses his train of thought , or forgets a player 's name ) and `` Okel Dokel '' ( his version of `` okey dokey '' ) . [ 8 ] Cope often used Yiddish expressions , especially `` Feh ! '' and `` Yoi ! '' ( sometimes multiplied as `` Double Yoi '' or rarely `` Triple Yoi '' ) . Cope also created nicknames for many players and opposing teams . It was Cope who popularized `` The Bus '' as a nickname for former Steelers running back Jerome Bettis , `` Jack Splat '' for Jack Lambert , and he gave Kordell Stewart the nickname `` Slash . '' [ 19 ] Cope also used the term `` Cincinnati Bungles '' to describe their division rivals , known during the 1990s for a string of bad seasons and numerous draft busts . [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] Myron also used terms such as `` Brownies , '' `` Birdies , '' `` Yonkos , '' `` Cryboys , '' and `` Redfaces '' for the football teams from Cleveland , Baltimore , Denver , Dallas , Washington , D.C. , in respective order . [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] Cope was noted for accusing future Hall of Famer Roberto Clemente of being `` baseball 's champion hypochondriac '' . [ 27 ] Terrible Towel [ edit ] Main article : Terrible Towel I said , what we need is something that everybody already has , so it does n't cost a dime . So I says , 'We 'll urge people to bring out to the game gold or black towels , ' then I 'll tell people if you do n't have a yellow , black or gold towel , buy one . And if you do n't want to buy one , dye one . We 'll call this the Terrible Towel . â€” Myron Cope on the invention of the Terrible Towel [ 28 ] Cope played a large role in the invention of the Terrible Towel . [ 29 ] Needing a way to excite the fans during a 1975 playoff game against the Baltimore Colts , Cope urged fans to take yellow dish towels to the game and wave them throughout . [ 28 ] Originally , Cope wanted to sell rubber Jack Lambert masks , but realizing the high costs for the masks , opted for the inexpensive option for the Terrible Towel . The Terrible Towel has gained much popularity since its invention and `` is arguably the best-known fan symbol of any major pro sports team '' . [ 29 ] The catchphrase is : `` The Terrible Towel is poised to strike , and so are The Steelers . '' In 1996 , Cope gave the rights to The Terrible Towel to the Allegheny Valley School in Coraopolis , Pennsylvania . [ 14 ] The school provides care for more than 900 people [ 30 ] with intellectual disabilities and physical disabilities , including Cope 's son who has severe autism . [ 2 ] Proceeds from the Terrible Towel have helped raise $ 3 million for the school . [ 31 ] Retirement and death [ edit ] A special edition of `` The Terrible Towel '' was created in honor of Cope 's retirement following the 2005 Steelers ' season . Cope announced his retirement from broadcasting on June 20 , 2005 , citing health concerns . [ 32 ] Eight days later , it was announced that Cope was the recipient of the Pete Rozelle Award for `` long-time exceptional contributions to radio and television in professional football . '' [ 33 ] Upon his retirement , the Steelers did not replace Cope , opting instead to downsize to a two-man broadcast team . [ 13 ] On October 31 , 2005 , Cope was honored for his lifetime accomplishments at halftime of the contest between the Steelers and the Ravens . [ 34 ] In addition , the Steelers produced a special commemorative edition Terrible Towel with his familiar expressions printed on it . As seen on the towel , production was limited to 35,000 towels , representing 35 years of service to the Steelers . Later that season when the team advanced to Super Bowl XL , many Steelers fans wanted Cope to come out of retirement just to call `` The one for the thumb . '' Cope declined partially for health reasons and partially to enjoy retirement . [ citation needed ] A longtime heavy smoker , Cope died of respiratory failure at a Mt . Lebanon nursing home on the morning of February 27 , 2008 . [ 13 ] [ 35 ] In the days following his death , many ceremonies were held in his honor , including the local sporting events of the Pittsburgh Panthers college basketball team . [ 36 ] Two days after his death , hundreds of people gathered in heavy snow in front of the Pittsburgh City Hall to honor Cope ; included in the ceremony was one minute of silent Terrible Towel waving . [ 37 ] His funeral , which was held on February 29 , 2008 , was private . [ 38 ] Due to Cope 's large impact on the Pittsburgh area , Bob Smizik , a local sportswriter wrote , Had the secret of the service and its site not been kept , ... tens of thousands would have descended on the Slater funeral home in Green Tree . Such was the affection for Cope , ... that the parkway in both directions would have
