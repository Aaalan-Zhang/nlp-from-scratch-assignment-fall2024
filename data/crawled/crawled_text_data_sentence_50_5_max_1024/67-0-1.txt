At dawn on Easter Sunday , Turiddu sings in the distance of his love for Lola , wife of the carter Alfio . She and Turiddu had been a couple before he joined the army . When he returned and found her married to Alfio , he seduced Santuzza but now has abandoned her and rekindled his relationship with Lola . Later in the morning , a distraught Santuzza approaches the tavern of Mamma Lucia , Turiddu ’ s mother , who tells her that her son is away buying wine . But Santuzza knows that Turiddu has been seen during the night in the village . Alfio arrives with a group of men , boasting of his horses—and of Lola . He asks Mamma Lucia if she has any more of her good wine . When she says that Turiddu has gone to get more , Alfio replies that he saw him near his house that same morning . Lucia is surprised , but Santuzza tells her to keep quiet . As the villagers follow the procession to church , Santuzza stays behind and pours out her grief about Turiddu to Mamma Lucia . The old woman expresses her pity , then also leaves for Mass . Turiddu arrives in the piazza . When Santuzza confronts him about his affair with Lola , he denies her accusations . Just then Lola passes by on her way to church . She mocks Santuzza , and Turiddu turns to follow her . Santuzza begs him to stay and implores him not to abandon her . Refusing to listen , Turiddu leaves , and Santuzza curses him . Alfio appears , late for Mass .
