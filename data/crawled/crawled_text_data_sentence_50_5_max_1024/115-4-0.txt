Football [ edit ] College football in Pittsburgh dates back to the University of Pittsburgh which first organized a football team in 1889 and played its first sanctioned game in 1890 . In the first half of the 20th century , Pitt , Duquesne , and Carnegie Tech ( now called Carnegie Mellon ) all fielded football squads that made `` major '' bowl game appearances from the 1920s through the 1930s . These appearances included Duquesne in the 1933 and 1936 Orange Bowl , Carnegie Tech in the 1938 Sugar Bowl , and the University of Pittsburgh appearing in four Rose Bowls ( 1927 , 1929 , 1932 , 1936 ) as well as nearby Washington and Jefferson College in the 1922 Rose Bowl . [ 55 ] In particular , Pitt was a national power during this era , claiming 8 national championships under the guidance of coaching legends such as Pop Warner and Jock Sutherland . More recently , the Panthers won another National Championship in 1976 and competed for several more through the 1980s . Multiple inductees into the College Football Hall of Fame played at Pitt , including Dan Marino , Tony Dorsett , Mike Ditka , and Larry Fitzgerald .

Since the 2000â€“2001 season , a team from the region has always reached a post-season tournament , with Pitt having won multiple Big East Conference championships and having appeared in nine consecutive NCAA Tournaments , advancing to the Sweet 16 four times and the Elite Eight once .
