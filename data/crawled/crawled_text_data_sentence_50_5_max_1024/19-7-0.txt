Student organizations provide social , service , media , academic , spiritual , recreational , sport , religious , political , cultural , and governance opportunities . Carnegie Mellon 's campus houses several galleries such as The Frame , a student-devoted gallery , and the Regina Gouger Miller Gallery , an art gallery that specializes in contemporary professional artists . The Carnegie Mellon School of Music , Carnegie Mellon School of Drama , and the student-run theatrical organization Scotch ' n'Soda provides campus with a variety of performance arts events . The university has a strong Scottish motif inspired by Andrew Carnegie 's Scottish heritage , as well as the Mellon family 's Scots-Irish ancestry . Examples include Scotty , the Scottish Terrier mascot , The Tartan student newspaper , Skibo Gymnasium , The Thistle yearbook , and the CÃ©ilidh weekend every fall semester for homecoming . [ 155 ] Traditions [ edit ] Main article : Carnegie Mellon University traditions The Fence In the early days of Carnegie Tech , there was a single bridge connecting Margaret Morrison Women 's College with the Carnegie Institute of Technology . The bridge was a meeting place for students . In 1916 , the bridge was taken down and the university filled in the area . The administration built a wooden fence as a new meeting place . The students did not understand why anyone would want to meet at a fence . The administration was about to give up and tear it down , but that night a fraternity , as a prank , painted the entire fence advertising a fraternity party . Ever since , painting the Fence has been a Carnegie Mellon tradition . [ 156 ] The Fence at Carnegie Mellon lies at the center of campus , in the area known as `` the Cut '' . Students guard the fence 24 hours a day , and , as long as two vigils are maintained , no other student may `` take '' the fence . The fence can then be painted by the group that has it , but only between midnight and 6 am . Only hand brushes may be used ; the use of spray paint or paint rollers is considered vandalism and results in a fine . The previous paint can not be stripped , and each new painting adds a new layer . The original wooden fence finally collapsed in the 1990s due to the weight from over 1 ' of surrounding paint , and was immediately replaced with an identical one manufactured from concrete . Today the fence is considered `` the world 's most painted object '' by the Guinness Book of World Records . [ 157 ] Housing [ edit ] Carnegie Mellon offers conventional housing for its students through single-gender , coresidential , and special interest options . Students can choose from a variety of housing options . The four options for students are traditional , semi-suite , suite , and apartments . The Traditional is a typical college dormitory setting , a long hallway with a series of 1-3 person rooms and a community bathroom shared with an entire floor or wing . Semi-Suite offers more privacy through 1-4 person rooms with 3-5 residents sharing one semi-private bathroom . Suite is similar to Semi-Suite but contains additional bedrooms , a bathroom , and living room/lounge area shared with 3-8 other residents . Apartments are shared between 1-3 people and may contain additional bedrooms , a semi-private bathroom , a living room , and kitchen shared with the other residents . Upperclassmen have
