Pre-selected audience members served as beta testers and provided positive feedback on their experiences . Thanks to an Innovation Grant from OPERA America funded by the Ann and Gordon Getty Foundation , Pittsburgh Opera partnered with Instant Encore to add real-time audio capabilities to LiveNote® . We began testing these capabilities in January 2019 at our performances of afterWARds – Mozart ’ s Idomeneo Reimagined , and continued testing throughout the remainder of our 2018-19 season . Great care had already been taken to ensure the app would not disrupt nearby patrons . After our 2018-19 season ended , Pittsburgh Opera and Instant Encore added additional safeguards to minimize light seepage and reduce the risk of incoming phone calls startling users . With these additional safeguards in place , we publicly rolled out the functionality at the beginning of our 2019-20 season . We will continue to monitor and adjust the app over time . 2425 LIBERTY AVE.
