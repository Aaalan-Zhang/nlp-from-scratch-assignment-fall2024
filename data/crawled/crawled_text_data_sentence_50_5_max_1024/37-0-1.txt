newspaper described his conducting as `` forceful , authentic , modern music '' , [ 15 ] and he was invited to conduct in Moscow . He had taught at Duquesne University and been a band leader in the Navy prior to his work in Europe and with the Symphony . [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] This program of frequent guest conductors was made in an effort to restore the symphony to its `` golden years , '' but in effect demoted Modarelli , who was finally asked by the Board to resign in 1936 . [ 19 ] Otto Klemperer was responsible for bringing in much new talent while working with the Musicians ' Union to hire both local and imported performers . [ 20 ] Since then , the orchestra has experienced ongoing growth and development , including building a substantial endowment fund . [ citation needed ] 1938–1948 : The Reiner years [ edit ] Fritz Reiner was music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony from 1938 to 1948 . Reiner studied with Hungarian composer Béla Bartók and programmed many of Bartók 's works in Pittsburgh Symphony performances . [ 21 ] [ 22 ] Women joined the orchestra for the first time during World War II . Eighteen women joined in 1942 , and 24 more women joined in 1944 . The PSO had more female performers than any other major American symphony during the war . [ 21 ] Victor De Sabata came to Pittsburgh in 1948 , in part because of the urgings of his colleague Vladimir Bakaleinikoff , whom he had conducted in Cincinnati in 1927 . Ticket sales increased with de Sabata at the helm . He was so popular with local audiences that around 1,200 people attended a concert he conducted at the Syria Mosque during one of Pittsburgh 's worst snowstorms . [ 23 ] He returned to conduct the orchestra in 1949 , 1950 , and 1951 . [ 24 ] The orchestra established a Guest Conductor Chair in his name in 2010 . 1952–1976 : The Steinberg years [ edit ] William Steinberg became the orchestra 's music director in 1952 . During the early part of the 1950s , the Symphony played a number of `` industry concerts '' , conducted by Steinberg and sponsored by area industries , specifically the United Steelworkers of America . The sponsorship offset costs for industry workers , and the Symphony performed in more convenient locations throughout Pennsylvania , Ohio , and West Virginia . [ 25 ] [ 26 ] The Symphony continued to bring music to smaller communities in partnership with Manufacturers Heat and Light Company and Columbia Gas during the Steinberg era . [ 27 ] The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra performed for audiences in Warsaw , Madrid , Berlin , Zagreb , Reykjavik , and 15 other locations throughout Europe and the Middle East during the State Department tour . [ 28 ] Many of the orchestra 's earlier recordings were made in the Syrian Mosque with labels such as Capitol Records and Columbia Records . [ 29 ] The Pittsburgh Symphony performed at the Syria Mosque from 1926 until 1971 . The building was torn down in 1992 . Steinberg and the Pittsburgh Symphony made several recordings for the Command label starting in 1962 . These recordings were made at the Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall in Pittsburgh . The technical superiority of the Command recordings was aided by the company 's use of 35mm film as the recording medium . [ 30 ] Steinberg conducted his final Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra concerts as music director in 1976 , after which he returned for guest-conducting appearances as music director emeritus . [ 31 ] [ 32 ] 1976–1984 : The Previn years [ edit ] André Previn succeeded Steinberg as music director in 1976 . Previn had a collegial working style with symphony musicians and even formed a chamber music trio with Herbert Greenberg , associate concertmaster , and principal cellist Anne Martindale Williams around 1979 . [ 33 ] In 1981 , Previn renewed his contract with the symphony orchestra . [ 34 ] During this time , Victoria Bond served as an affiliate conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra from 1978 to 1980 .
