By 1910 , Pittsburgh was the nation 's eighth-largest city , accounting for between one-third and one-half of national steel output . The Pittsburgh Agreement was subscribed in May 1918 between the Czech and Slovak nationalities , as envisioned by T. G. Masaryk , concerning the future foundation of Czechoslovakia . [ 43 ] The city suffered severe flooding in March 1936 . The city 's population swelled to more than a half million , attracting numerous European immigrants to its industrial jobs . By 1940 , non-Hispanic whites were 90.6 % of the city 's population . [ 44 ] Pittsburgh also became a main destination of the African-American Great Migration from the rural South during the first half of the 20th century . [ 45 ] Limited initially by discrimination , some 95 % percent of the men became unskilled steel workers . [ 46 ] During World War II , demand for steel increased and area mills operated 24 hours a day to produce 95 million tons of steel for the war effort . [ 29 ] This resulted in the highest levels of air pollution in the city 's almost century of industry . The city 's reputation as the `` arsenal of democracy '' [ 47 ] [ 48 ] was being overshadowed by James Parton 's 1868 observation of Pittsburgh being `` hell with the lid off . '' [ 49 ] Following World War II , the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the `` Renaissance , '' cleaning up the air and the rivers . The `` Renaissance II '' project followed in 1977 , focused on cultural and neighborhood development . The industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s , but beginning in the early 1980s both the area 's steel and electronics industries imploded during national industrial restructuring . There were massive layoffs from mill and plant closures .
