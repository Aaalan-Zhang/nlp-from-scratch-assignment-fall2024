During warmer months , this is the place to see tons of national touring acts outside and with a nice lawn space . During colder months , the indoor vibe here can still fit major acts with incredible sound fidelity and lighting , or scaled all the way down to their Club at Stage AE experience for smaller acts . Besides Smalls and Roxian , this is the venue I probably end up going to the most . There 's a huge variety of genres that pass through here and the live experience somehow manages to still feel intimate even with 5,000 others around you . Pro Tip : Add the Quick Pass to your tickets and avoid waiting in line hours in advance to get to the front row for GA shows . This add on gives you your own line and easy entry to the venue . UPMC Events Center With seating for 4,000 , the UPMC Events Center on the RMU campus in Moon Township is the best large venue you have yet to see a show at . Opened in 2019 , this event venue transforms into a full concert experience with full load-ins for nationally touring acts , local legends and comedians . And do n't worry about this being a college campus ; their concourse offers full concessions and seasonal beer offerings to keep the party going . Pro Tip : Parking is free here ! Howl at the Moon The possibilities of live music and theatre surround you in the cultural district , but for a guaranteed good night out , Howl at the Moon should be your Downtown destination . This dueling piano bar brings hilarious and high-quality live entertainment and is perfect for those that want to dance and be involved with the show , plus a rotating list of drink specials and themed holiday nights also make it a great stop for parties , corporate events and more . Hard Rock Cafe Baseball , apple pie , and Hard Rock Cafe . These American institutions have been around for a reason , and our Hard Rock location in Station Square offers beautiful city reviews , a variety of live music from local performers , unplugged brunch acoustic events , karaoke and more . Plus , you ca n't beat the views from our south shore for a scenic view of the city . Rivers Casino While most people think of casinos for gambling , drinks and great food , Rivers Casino also provides a ton of live entertainment to patrons . National acts like Styx and DJ Pauly D have filled their Events Center , but my favorite venue here is their Drum Bar
