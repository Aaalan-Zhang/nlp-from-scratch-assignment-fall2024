Scots Irish leadership [ edit ] Ingham ( 1978 ) examined the leadership of the industry in its most important center , Pittsburgh , as well as smaller cities . He concludes that the leadership of the iron and steel industry nationwide was `` largely Scotch Irish '' . Ingham finds that the Scotch Irish held together cohesively throughout the 19th century and `` developed their own sense of uniqueness . '' [ 36 ] New immigrants after 1800 made Pittsburgh a major Scotch-Irish stronghold . For example , Thomas Mellon ( b. Ulster 1813–1908 ) left northern Ireland in 1823 for the United States . He founded the powerful Mellon family , which played a central role in banking and industries such as aluminum and oil . As Barnhisel ( 2005 ) finds , industrialists such as James Laughlin ( b. Ulster 1806–1882 ) of Jones and Laughlin Steel Company comprised the `` Scots-Irish Presbyterian ruling stratum of Pittsburgh society . '' [ 37 ] Technology [ edit ] In 1859 , the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced coke -fire smelting to the region .
