The Crawfords finished their eight-year existence with a .633 winning percentage , with a line-up including Gibson , Cool Papa Bell , and Satchel Paige and claimed four straight league titles from 1933 until 1936 , with the 1935 team judged by some [ who ? ] as the greatest one to ever take the field in the Negro leagues , or perhaps in baseball period . Just as they initially played in the first `` modern '' ballpark in the majors ( Forbes Field ) , Crawfords owner Gus Greenlee constructed the first steel and concrete `` modern '' stadium in the Negro leagues , with Greenlee Field opening in the Hill District on April 29 , 1932 .

The franchise made it to the championship round in the 1994–95 season . Taking the series into the 6th game the Piranhas lost by a basket in the final seconds ( 92-94 ) by what they claimed was an ineligible player , the CBA denied a replay game in what would have been Pittsburgh 's second pro-basketball world title .
