[ 99 ] This is caused by frequently overflowing untreated sewage into local waterways , due to flood conditions and antiquated infrastructure . Pittsburgh has a combined sewer system , where its sewage pipes contain both stormwater and wastewater . The pipes were constructed in the early 1900s , and the sewage treatment plant was built in 1959 . [ 100 ] Due to insufficient improvements over time , the city is faced with public health concerns regarding its water . [ 101 ] As little as a tenth of an inch of rain causes runoffs from the sewage system to drain into local rivers . [ 102 ] Nine billion gallons of untreated waste and stormwater flow into rivers , leading to health hazards and Clean Water Act violations . [ 103 ] The local sewage authority , Allegheny County Sanitary Authority , or ALCOSAN , is operating under Consent Decree from the EPA to come up with solutions . [ 104 ] In 2017 , ALCOSAN proposed a $ 2 billion upgrade to the system which was approved by the EPA in 2019 . [ 105 ] [ 106 ] Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority ( PWSA ) is the city 's agency required to replace pipes and charge water rates . They have come under fire from both city and state authorities due to alleged mismanagement . [ 107 ] In 2017 , Mayor William Peduto advocated for a restructuring of the PWSA and a partially privatized water authority . [ 108 ] Governor Wolf subsequently assigned the PWSA to be under the oversight of the Public Utilities Commission ( PUC ) . [ 107 ] PWSA has also been subject to criticism due to findings released in 2016 showing high levels of lead in Pittsburgh 's drinking water . [ 109 ] Although Pittsburgh 's drinking water had been high in lead levels , and steadily rising , for many years , many residents blame PWSA administrative changes for the spike in lead levels . [ 110 ] In the years prior , PWSA had hired Veolia , a Paris-based company , for consultation to help with mounting administrative difficulties . [ 111 ] By 2015 , PWSA in consultation with Veolia had laid off 23 people , including halving the laboratory staff that was responsible for testing water safety and quality . [ 111 ] Simultaneously , PWSA in consultation with Veolia had changed what chemicals they were using to prevent metal corrosion in 2014 , [ 110 ] from soda ash to caustic soda , without consulting with Department of Environmental Protection . [ 112 ] Anti-corrosive chemicals were being used because many of Pittsburgh 's water pipes were made of lead , and adding anti-corrosive chemicals helped prevent lead from seeping into drinking water . [ 112 ] In 2016 lead levels were as high as 27 ppb in some cases . The legal limit is 15 ppb , although there is not a safe amount of lead in drinking water . [ 112 ] Though lead levels had been rising in previous years , they had not exceeded the legal limit . [ 110 ] In late 2015 PWSA terminated its contracted with Veolia . [ 111 ] In response to the high lead levels PWSA began adding orthophosphate to the water . [ 113 ] Orthophosphate is meant to create a coating on the inside of pipes , creating a barrier to prevent lead from leaching into drinking water . [ 113 ] PWSA has also been working to replace lead pipes , and continuing to test water for lead . [ 113 ] There remains concern among residents over the long-term effects of this lead , particularly for children , in whom lead causes permanent damage to the brain and nervous system . [ 114 ] Some people also believe that the high levels of lead reflect environmental racism , as black and Hispanic children in Pittsburgh experience elevated blood-lead levels at 4 times the rate of white children . [ 114 ] Water fountains in Langley k-8 school in Sheraden were found to have the highest levels of lead of any schools in the Pittsburgh area . These levels were about 11 times the legal limit . Some residents believe this is due to Langely being a predominantly black school , with 89 % of the student body being eligible for the free lunch program .
