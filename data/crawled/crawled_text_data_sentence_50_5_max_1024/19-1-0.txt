The Cut was formed by filling in a ravine ( hence the name ) with soil from a nearby hill that was leveled to build the College of Fine Arts building . The northwestern part of the campus ( home to Hamburg Hall , Newell-Simon Hall , Smith Hall , and Gates Hillman Complex ) was acquired from the United States Bureau of Mines in the 1980s . Carnegie Mellon has been purchasing 100 % renewable energy for its electricity since 2011 .

Also visible are `` The Fence '' , and the Walking to the Sky sculpture . Campus architecture and design [ edit ] The campus began to take shape in the Beaux-Arts architecture style of George Carnegie Palmer and Henry Hornbostel of Palmer & Hornbostel , winners of the 1904 competition to design the original institution and later the founder of the Carnegie Mellon School of Architecture . [ 26 ] There was little change to the campus between the first and second World War . A 1938 master plan by Githens and Keally suggested acquisition of new land along Forbes Avenue , but the plan was not fully implemented . The period starting with the construction of the Hall of the Arts building ( former home of the Graduate School of Industrial Administration ) in 1952 and ending with Wean Hall in 1971 saw the institutional change from Carnegie Institute of Technology to Carnegie Mellon University . New facilities were needed to respond to the university 's growing national reputation in artificial intelligence , business , robotics and the arts . In addition , an expanding student population demanded improved facilities for student life , athletics and libraries . The campus finally expanded to Forbes Avenue from its original land along Schenley Park . Hamerschlag , Roberts , and Scott Halls are three of the teaching facilities of the College of Engineering The buildings of this era reflected contemporary architectural styles . The International Style , with its rejection of historical tradition and its emphases on functionalism and expression of structure , had been in vogue in European settings since the 1930s . It came late to the Carnegie Mellon campus because of the hiatus in building activity and a general reluctance among American universities to abandon historical styles . By the 1960s , the International Style was adopted to accomplish needed expansion quickly and affordably with the swelling of student ranks in the aftermath of the GI Bill in 1944 . Each building was a unique architectural statement that may have acknowledged the existing campus in its placement , but not in its form or materials . During the 1970s and 1980s , the tenure of president Richard Cyert ( 1972–1990 ) witnessed a period of growth and development . The research budget grew from roughly $ 12 million annually in the early 1970s to more than $ 110 million in the late 1980s . Researchers in new fields like robotics and software engineering helped the university to build its reputation . One example was the introduction of the `` Andrew `` computing network in the mid-1980s . This project linking all computers and workstations on campus set the standard for educational computing and established Carnegie Mellon as a technology leader in education and research . On April 24 , 1985 , cmu.edu , Carnegie Mellon 's Internet domain , became one of the first six .edu domain names . Since the 1990s [ edit ] Wean Hall , home of the world 's first internet-enabled soda vending machine . [ 27 ] In the 1990s and into the 2000s , Carnegie Mellon solidified its status among American universities , consistently ranking in the top 25 in the national U.S. News & World Report rankings , and in the top 30 ( ranking 28th in 2022 ) amongst universities worldwide . [ 28 ] [ 29 ] Carnegie Mellon is distinct in its interdisciplinary approach to research and education . Through the establishment of programs and centers outside the limitations of departments or colleges , the university has established leadership in fields such as computational finance , information systems , cognitive sciences , management , arts management , product design , behavioral economics , energy science and economics , human–computer interaction , entertainment technology , and decision science . Within the past two decades , the university has built a new university center ( Cohon University Center ) , theater and drama building ( Purnell Center for the Arts ) , business school building ( Tepper School of Business ) , and several dormitories . Baker Hall was renovated in the early 2000s , and new chemistry labs were established in Doherty Hall soon after . Several computer science buildings , such as Newell-Simon Hall , also were established , renovated or renamed in the early 2000s . In 2006 , Carnegie Mellon Trustee Jill Gansman Kraus donated the 80-foot ( 24 m ) -tall sculpture Walking to the Sky , which was placed on the lawn facing Forbes Avenue between the Cohon University Center and Warner Hall . The sculpture was controversial for its placement , the general lack of input from the campus community , and its ( lack of ) aesthetic appeal .
