that a high rate of people on relief was not only `` a challenge '' but also `` an opportunity . '' He regarded each relief job as Democratic patronage . [ 67 ] 1940s [ edit ] Pittsburgh was at the center of the `` Arsenal of Democracy `` that provided steel , aluminum , munitions and machinery for the U.S. during World War II . Pittsburgh 's mills contributed 95 million tons of steel to the war effort . The increased production output created a workforce shortage , which resulted in African Americans moving en masse during the Second Great Migration from the South to the city in order to find work . [ 11 ] Postwar [ edit ] David Lawrence , a Democrat , served as mayor of Pittsburgh from 1946 to 1959 and as Pennsylvania 's governor from 1959 to 1963 . [ 68 ] Lawrence used his political power to transform Pittsburgh 's political machine into a modern governmental unit that could run the city well and honestly . [ 69 ] In 1946 Lawrence decided to enforce the Smoke Control Ordinance of 1941 because he believed smoke abatement was crucial for the city 's future economic development . However , enforcement placed a substantial burden on the city 's working-class because smoky bituminous coal was much less expensive than smokeless fuels . One round of protests came from Italian-American organizations , which called for delay in enforcing it . Enforcement raised their cost of living and threatened the jobs of their relatives in nearby bituminous coal mines . Despite dislike of the smoke abatement program , Italian Americans strongly supported the reelection of Lawrence in 1949 , in part because many of them were on the city payroll .

For the basketball team , see Pittsburgh Rens . The multi-purpose Three Rivers Stadium was built in 1970 as part of the Renaissance I project . It was imploded in 2001 . Rich and productive , Pittsburgh was also the `` Smoky City , '' with smog sometimes so thick that streetlights burned during the day [ 11 ] as well as rivers that resembled open sewers . Civic leaders , notably Mayor David L. Lawrence , elected in 1945 , Richard K. Mellon , chairman of Mellon Bank and John P. Robin [ 71 ] [ 72 ] began smoke control and urban revitalization , also known as Urban Renewal projects that transformed the city [ 11 ] in unforeseen ways . `` Renaissance I '' began in 1946 . Title One of the Housing Act of 1949 provided the means in which to begin . By 1950 , vast swaths of buildings and land near the Point were demolished for Gateway Center . 1953 saw the opening of the ( since demolished ) Greater Pittsburgh Municipal Airport terminal . [ 27 ] In the late 1950s and early 1960s , the lower Hill District , an area inhabited predominantly by poor Blacks , was completely destroyed . Ninety-five acres of the lower Hill District were cleared using eminent domain , forcibly displacing hundreds of small businesses and more than 8,000 people ( 1,239 black families , 312 white ) , to make room for a cultural center that included the Civic Arena , which opened in 1961 .
