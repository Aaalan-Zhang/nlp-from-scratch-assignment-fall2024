between 2014 and 2016 researchers determined that children who lived in areas close to sources of pollution , such as industrial sites , experienced rates of asthma at almost 3 times the national average . [ 95 ] The study also found that 38 % of students live in areas over USEPA 's 12 micrograms per cubic meter standards , while 70 % live in areas over the WHO 's standard of 10 micrograms per cubic meter . [ 95 ] Several of the plants were located in or very near Pittsburgh . [ 95 ] The study also noted that most of the effected communities were minority communities . [ 95 ] This had led some residents in Pittsburgh to believe that the continuing effects of air pollution are a case of environmental racism . [ 96 ] Groups such as Women for a Healthy Environment are working to address ongoing concerns surrounding air pollution in Pittsburgh . [ 97 ] WHE does work such as policy analysis , publishing reports , and community education . [ 97 ] In the summer of 2017 , a crowd sourced air quality monitoring application , Smell PGH , was launched . As air quality is still a concern of many in the area , the app allows for users to report odd smells and informs local authorities . [ 98 ] Water quality [ edit ] The local rivers continue to have pollution levels exceeding EPA limits . [ 99 ] This is caused by frequently overflowing untreated sewage into local waterways , due to flood conditions and antiquated infrastructure . Pittsburgh has a combined sewer system , where its sewage pipes contain both stormwater and wastewater . The pipes were constructed in the early 1900s , and the sewage treatment plant was built in 1959 . [ 100 ] Due to insufficient improvements over time , the city is faced with public health concerns regarding its water . [ 101 ] As little as a tenth of an inch of rain causes runoffs from the sewage system to drain into local rivers . [ 102 ] Nine billion gallons of untreated waste and stormwater flow into rivers , leading to health hazards and Clean Water Act violations . [ 103 ] The local sewage authority , Allegheny County Sanitary Authority , or ALCOSAN , is operating under Consent Decree from the EPA to come up with solutions . [ 104 ] In 2017 , ALCOSAN proposed a $ 2 billion upgrade to the system which was approved by the EPA in 2019 . [ 105 ] [ 106 ] Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority ( PWSA ) is the city 's agency required to replace pipes and charge water rates . They have come under fire from both city and state authorities due to alleged mismanagement . [ 107 ] In 2017 , Mayor William Peduto advocated for a restructuring of the PWSA and a partially privatized water authority . [ 108 ] Governor Wolf subsequently assigned the PWSA to be under the oversight of the Public Utilities Commission ( PUC ) . [ 107 ] PWSA has also been subject to criticism due to findings released in 2016 showing high levels of lead in Pittsburgh 's drinking water . [ 109 ] Although Pittsburgh 's drinking water had been high in lead levels , and steadily rising , for many years , many residents blame PWSA administrative changes for the spike in lead levels . [ 110 ] In the years prior , PWSA had hired Veolia , a Paris-based company , for consultation to help with mounting administrative difficulties .
