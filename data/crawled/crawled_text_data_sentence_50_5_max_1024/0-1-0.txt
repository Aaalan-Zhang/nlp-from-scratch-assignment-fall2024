[ 28 ] The British and colonial force were defeated at Braddock 's Field . General John Forbes finally took the forks in 1758 . He began construction on Fort Pitt , named after William Pitt the Elder , while the settlement was named `` Pittsborough '' . [ 29 ] During Pontiac 's War , a loose confederation of Native American tribes laid siege to Fort Pitt in 1763 ; the siege was eventually lifted after Colonel Henry Bouquet defeated a portion of the besieging force at the Battle of Bushy Run . Bouquet strengthened the defenses of Fort Pitt the next year . [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] During this period , the powerful nations of the Iroquois Confederacy , based in New York , had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes . By the terms of the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix , the Penns were allowed to purchase the modern region from the Iroquois . A 1769 survey referenced the future city as the `` Manor of Pittsburgh '' . [ 34 ] Both the Colony of Virginia and the Province of Pennsylvania claimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780 , when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend the Masonâ€“Dixon line westward , placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania . On March 8 , 1771 , Bedford County , Pennsylvania was created to govern the frontier . On April 16 , 1771 , the city 's first civilian local government was created as Pitt Township . [ 35 ] [ 36 ] William Teagarden was the first constable , and William Troop was the first clerk . [ 37 ] Following the American Revolution , the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow . One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the Ohio Country . In 1784 , Thomas Vickroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney . Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785 . The following year , the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was started , and in 1787 , the Pittsburgh Academy was chartered . Unrest during the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area . By 1797 , glass manufacture began , while the population grew to around 1,400 . Settlers arrived after crossing the Appalachian Mountains or through the Great Lakes . Fort Pitt ( now Pittsburgh ) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into the Northwest Territory . 19th century [ edit ] Further information : Pennsylvania in the American Civil War The Monongahela River and its surroundings in 1857 Lithograph of Pittsburgh by Otto Krebs ( before 1874 ) Burning of Union Depot during the Pittsburgh railroad strike of 1877 The federal government recognizes Pittsburgh as the starting point for the Lewis and Clark Expedition . [ 38 ] Preparations began in Pittsburgh in 1803 when Meriwether Lewis purchased a keelboat that would later be used to ascend the Missouri River . [ 39 ] The War of 1812 cut off the supply of British goods , stimulating American industry . By 1815 , Pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of iron , brass , tin , and glass . On March 18 , 1816 , the 46-year-old local government became a city . It was served by numerous river steamboats that increased trading traffic on the rivers . In the 1830s , many Welsh people from the Merthyr steelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the Merthyr Rising . By the 1840s , Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains . The Great Fire of Pittsburgh destroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845 . The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape the Great Famine . By 1857 , Pittsburgh 's 1,000 factories were consuming 22 million coal bushels yearly . Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area , with the most coming from Germany . Because Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution , enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South , or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city . There were active stations of the Underground Railroad in the city , and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and African-American workers in city hotels . The Drennen Slave Girl walked out of the Monongahela House in 1850 , apparently to freedom . [ 40 ] The Merchant 's Hotel was also a place where African-American workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the Underground Railroad . [ 41 ] Sometimes refugee slaves from the South stayed in Pittsburgh , but other times they continued North , including into Canada . Many slaves left the city and county for Canada after Congress passed the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act , as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties . From 1850 to 1860 , the black population in Allegheny County dropped from 3,431 to 2,725 as people headed to more safety in Canada . [ 40 ] The American Civil War boosted the city 's economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union . Andrew Carnegie began steel production in 1875 at the Edgar Thomson Steel Works in North Braddock , Pennsylvania , which evolved into the Carnegie Steel Company . He adopted the Bessemer process to increase production . Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region . Railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers , increasing transportation access to important markets . 20th century [ edit ] An aerial view of Pittsburgh in 1902 [ 42 ] Steel mills in the Strip District in 1906 In 1901 , J.
