Lithograph by Thaddeus Mortimer Fowler . The history of Pittsburgh began with centuries of Native American civilization in the modern Pittsburgh region , known as Jaödeogë ’ in the Seneca language . [ 1 ] Eventually , European explorers encountered the strategic confluence where the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers meet to form the Ohio , which leads to the Mississippi River . The area became a battleground when France and Great Britain fought for control in the 1750s . When the British were victorious , the French ceded control of territories east of the Mississippi . Following American independence in 1783 , the village around Fort Pitt continued to grow . The region saw the short-lived Whiskey Rebellion , when farmers rebelled against federal taxes on whiskey . The War of 1812 cut off the supply of British goods , stimulating American manufacture . By 1815 , Pittsburgh was producing large quantities of iron , brass , tin , and glass products . By the 1840s , Pittsburgh had grown to be one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains . Production of steel began in 1875 . During the 1877 railway riots it was the site of the most violence and damage in any city affected by the nationwide strikes of that summer . Workers protested against cuts in wages , burning down buildings at the railyards , including 100 train engines and more than 1,000 cars . Forty men were killed , most of them strikers . By 1911 , Pittsburgh was producing half the nation 's steel . Pittsburgh was a Republican party stronghold until 1932 . The soaring unemployment of the Great Depression , the New Deal relief programs and the rise of powerful labor unions in the 1930s turned the city into a liberal stronghold of the New Deal Coalition under powerful Democratic mayors . In World War II , it was the center of the `` Arsenal of Democracy `` , producing munitions for the Allied war effort as prosperity returned . Following World War II , Pittsburgh launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the `` Renaissance . '' The industrial base continued to expand through the 1960s , but after 1970 foreign competition led to the collapse of the steel industry , with massive layoffs and mill closures . Top corporate headquarters moved out in the 1980s . In 2007 the city lost its status as a major transportation hub . The population of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area is holding steady at 2.4 million ; 65 % of its residents are of European descent and 35 % are minorities . Native American era [ edit ] Native Americans lived near the forks of the Ohio for thousands of years . These are some important villages , most c. 1750s , and earlier sites . For thousands of years , Native Americans inhabited the region where the Allegheny and the Monongahela join to form the Ohio . Paleo-Indians conducted a hunter-gatherer lifestyle in the region perhaps as early as 19,000 years ago . Meadowcroft Rockshelter , an archaeological site west of Pittsburgh , provides evidence that these first Americans lived in the region from that date . [ 2 ] During the Adena culture that followed , Mound Builders erected a large Indian Mound at the future site of McKees Rocks , about three miles ( 5 km ) from the head of the Ohio . The Indian Mound , a burial site , was augmented in later years by members of the Hopewell culture . [ 3 ] By 1700 the Haudenosaunee , the Five Nations-based south of the Great Lakes in present-day New York , held dominion over the upper Ohio valley , reserving it for hunting grounds . Other tribes included the Lenape , who had been displaced from eastern Pennsylvania by European settlement , and the Shawnee , who had migrated up from the south . [ 4 ] With the arrival of European explorers , these tribes and others had been devastated by infectious diseases from Europe , such as smallpox , measles , influenza , and malaria , to which they had no immunity .
