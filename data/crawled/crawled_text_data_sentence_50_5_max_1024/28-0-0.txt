Many of these traditions hearken to the university 's strength in engineering , such as the buggy races and the mobots , while others are purely social in nature , such as Spring Carnival and The Fence . [ 1 ] Alma Mater [ edit ] `` Alma Mater - Carnegie Mellon University '' Song Written 1924 ( 1924 ) Genre Alma mater Composer ( s ) J. Vick O'Brien Lyricist ( s ) Charles J. Taylor The alma mater of Carnegie Mellon University was written by Charles J. Taylor and set to music by J. Vick O'Brien when the university was still named Carnegie Institute of Technology . The song was copyrighted by the institute in 1924 . While not used as much as alma maters at some other universities , its alma mater plays a vital role in the culture and history of Carnegie Mellon University . It is sung at convocation ceremonies of incoming classes , commencement ceremonies of graduating classes , and other official events such as the investiture of new presidents . The university 's Kiltie Band plays it at certain home games . The full song has three verses . Normally , only the first verse is performed . Verses [ edit ] First Verse [ edit ] The first verse references the history of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania where the university is located . In the late-18th Century , after the United States won its independence , the settlement at the present city of Pittsburgh was known as the frontier and the Gateway to the West . The verse describes the wilderness through which the westward-bound settlers traversed to reach their goal . The verse concludes with the proud allusion that Carnegie Mellon was founded by Andrew Carnegie . [ 2 ] Here where spangled wildernesses Robed the fountains of the west , Where the savage strife and stresses Brought the settlers ' crimson quest ; Land of legend , glory graces , Gypsy tide and toiling shore , 'Mid thy hilltops Alma Mater Stands enthroned forever more . All Hail Carnegie Alma Mater Stands enthroned forever more . Second Verse [ edit ] The second verse begins with Pittsburgh 's role at the nation 's inception . It references the history of the labor movement through the Antebellum Era and Gilded Age . Upon its founding in 1900 , Andrew Carnegie had intended the university to be a vocational school for the children of the workers in his steel mills . As the university progressed , it embraced the arts as exemplified by the Carnegie Mellon School of Drama , the first degree-granting program in the country , while continuing to focus on its technical and scientific education . [ 2 ] The university maintains a strong collaborative culture among its constituent colleges ranging from the arts to the sciences . Here was heard the musket 's rattle , 'Round us roll 'd the thralling drum All is hush 'd , no more they startle , Now we hear sweet labor 's hum , Art and science rule our battle , In their pathway honor lies . Hail Carnegie Alma Mater Show the way that truth may rise ! All Hail Carnegie Alma Mater Show the way that truth may rise ! Third Verse [ edit ] The last verse references the university 's dedication to academic excellence and high-quality teaching , alluding to its continued pursuit of collecting and disseminating knowledge . Show the way arouse , awaken , Bear aloft the beacon bright , That our minds be ever taken , Unto learning , into light . Stand in daytime 's storm unshaken , Guide thro'storm of deepest night . Hail Carnegie Alma Mater Stand for progress , peace and right . All Hail Carnegie Alma Mater Stand for progress , peace and right ! The Fence [ edit ] The Fence , 2006 The first great tradition at Carnegie Mellon is The Fence , built in 1923 , which lies in the middle of the Cut . [ 3 ] The Fence frequently displays witty or poignant messages , but is just as often used to advertise upcoming events or recent accomplishments . Because of its highly visible location on campus , it is an ideal place to proclaim one 's message to as much of the student body as possible . The original wooden fence was replaced in 1993 when it collapsed under its own weight due to six inches of surrounding paint . At the time , it held the Guinness World Record for being the most painted object . [ 3 ] Today , a concrete and steel reinforced fence stands where the original one stood , imitating the size it would be today . Students
