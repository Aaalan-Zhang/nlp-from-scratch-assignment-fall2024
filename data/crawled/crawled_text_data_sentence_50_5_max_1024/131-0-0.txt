The museum was originally known as the Department of Fine Arts , Carnegie Institute and was formerly located at what is now the Main Branch of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh . The museum 's first gallery was opened for public use on November 5 , 1895 . Over the years , the gallery vastly increased in size , with a new building on Forbes Avenue built in 1907 . In 1963 , the name was officially changed to Museum of Art , Carnegie Institute . The size of the gallery has tripled over time , and it was officially renamed in 1986 to `` Carnegie Museum of Art '' to indicate it clearly as one of the four Carnegie Museums . [ 1 ] History [ edit ] Andrew Carnegie first thought of setting up a museum in 1886 [ 2 ] that would preserve a `` record of the progress and development of pictorial art in America . '' Dedicated on November 5 , 1895 , the art gallery was initially housed in the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh 's Main Branch in Oakland . Carnegie initially envisioned a museum collection consisting of the `` Old Masters of tomorrow '' . [ 3 ] The museum received a major expansion in 1907 with the addition of the Hall of Architecture , Hall of Sculpture , and Bruce Galleries , with funds again provided by Carnegie . [ 4 ] Under the directorship of Leon A. Arkus , the Sarah Mellon Scaife Gallery ( 125,000 square feet ) was built as an addition to the existing Carnegie Institute . Designed by architect Edward Larrabee Barnes , it first opened in 1974 and more than doubled the museum 's exhibition space , also adding a children 's studio , theater , café , offices , and bookstore . [ 5 ] The New York Times art critic John Russell described the gallery as an `` unflawed paradise . '' The gallery has been renovated several times since its original creation , most recently in 2004 . Today the museum also stages the Carnegie International every few years . Numerous significant works from the Internationals have been acquired for museum 's permanent collection including Winslow Homer 's The Wreck ( 1896 ) and James A. McNeill Whistler 's Arrangement in Black : Portrait of Señor Pablo de Sarasate ( 1884 ) . Collections and departments [ edit ] Neapolitan presepio seasonally displayed at the Carnegie Museum of Art The museum 's curatorial departments include : Fine Arts ( Contemporary Art , Works on Paper ) , Decorative Arts , Architecture and Photography .
