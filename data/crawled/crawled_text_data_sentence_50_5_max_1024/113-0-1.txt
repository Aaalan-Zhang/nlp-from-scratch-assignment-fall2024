television commentaries on WTAE-TV saw Cope calling himself `` Doctor Cope '' and wearing a white lab coat while pretending to examine the opposing team 's strengths and weaknesses . His predictor was known as the `` Cope-ra-scope . '' [ 17 ] In his last seven years , Cope would work alongside former Steelers offensive tackle Tunch Ilkin in the booth and help groom him for his own broadcasting career . Ilkin , upon his own retirement in 2021 due to complications from ALS ( which he would later die from on September 4 , 2021 ) , later joked that while he learned a lot from riding in the car with Cope for away games , Cope primarily rode with him because he allowed Cope to smoke cigarettes in the car . [ 18 ] Ilkin would eventually serve as a de facto replacement for Cope following Cope 's retirement . Catchphrases and nicknames [ edit ] Like other sports announcers in Pittsburgh , particularly Penguins commentator Mike Lange and the late Pirates announcer Bob Prince , Cope had a repertoire of unique catchphrases employed in his broadcasts , such as `` Mmm-Hah ! '' ( when he loses his train of thought , or forgets a player 's name ) and `` Okel Dokel '' ( his version of `` okey dokey '' ) . [ 8 ] Cope often used Yiddish expressions , especially `` Feh ! '' and `` Yoi ! '' ( sometimes multiplied as `` Double Yoi '' or rarely `` Triple Yoi '' ) . Cope also created nicknames for many players and opposing teams . It was Cope who popularized `` The Bus '' as a nickname for former Steelers running back Jerome Bettis , `` Jack Splat '' for Jack Lambert , and he gave Kordell Stewart the nickname `` Slash . '' [ 19 ] Cope also used the term `` Cincinnati Bungles '' to describe their division rivals , known during the 1990s for a string of bad seasons and numerous draft busts . [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] Myron also used terms such as `` Brownies , '' `` Birdies , '' `` Yonkos , '' `` Cryboys , '' and `` Redfaces '' for the football teams from Cleveland , Baltimore , Denver , Dallas , Washington , D.C. , in respective order . [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] Cope was noted for accusing future Hall of Famer Roberto Clemente of being `` baseball 's champion hypochondriac '' . [ 27 ] Terrible Towel [ edit ] Main article : Terrible Towel I said , what we need is something that everybody already has , so it does n't cost a dime . So I says , 'We 'll urge people to bring out to the game gold or black towels , ' then I 'll tell people if you do n't have a yellow , black or gold towel , buy one . And if you do n't want to buy one , dye one . We 'll call this the Terrible Towel .
