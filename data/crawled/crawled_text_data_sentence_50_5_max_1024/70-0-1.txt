she must grapple with a choice to save these priceless paintings or save her son—the thief . Burning the paintings would destroy the evidence of her son ’ s crime , but one of the paintings—Lucien Freud ’ s “ Woman With Eyes Closed ” —looks just like her own mother , a painter who died when Mona was still young . The uncanny resemblance unlocks long-buried memories that fuel the fires of three different possible endings . This world premiere opera from award-winning composer Jennifer Higdon ( Cold Mountain ) is inspired by a real-life art heist , and confronts the question “ what is the true value of a work of art ? ” This is an opera that needs to be seen at least twice ; each night of the production has the possibility of a completely new ending !

The police , the media , and the museum ’ s curator are desperate to find the culprit . In hopes of avoiding police detection , the thief ( Thomas ) has carelessly stuffed the stolen masterworks in a suitcase and abandoned them with his unsuspecting his Mother , Mona . In her son ’ s absence , the reclusive Mona investigates the contents of the suitcase discovering both the severity of her son ’ s crime as well as the innate beauty of each masterpiece . One painting in particular ( Lucian Freud ’ s WOMAN WITH EYES CLOSED ) awakens something deep inside Mona , shaking her to the very core . The painting bears astriking resemblance to Mona ’ s Mother , an amateur artist who died when Mona was child . The circumstances surrounding her Mother ’ s death have reverberated throughout Mona ’ s life . The police investigation continues to escalate , bringing an Inspector to Mona ’ s front door . Though Mona lies to the Inspector , successfully sending him on his way , she also knows that her flimsy deception is merely a temporary fix . The police already have evidence connecting Thomas to the crime . It ’ s a matter of time before he is apprehended . Mona must act quickly . Night falls . Mona sleeps . As she dreams , the Freud painting comes to life . Inside a liminal state , Mona and her Mother briefly reunite . Inside this memory , the two women examine the past . They navigate the pain and compromise of a life half-lived , a life starved for color , expression , and connection . Together , they unearth the past trauma that continues to define Mona ’ s future .
