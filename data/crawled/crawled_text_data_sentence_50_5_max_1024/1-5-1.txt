cities did not stop discharging raw sewage into rivers until 1939 . Pittsburgh 's smoke pollution , seen in the 1890s as a sign of prosperity , was recognized as a problem in the Progressive Era and was cleared up in the 1930s–1940s . Steel plants deposited mountains of slag until 1972 , especially in Nine Mile Run Valley . [ 55 ] In November 1927 , 28 people were killed and hundreds were wounded in an explosion of a gas tank . [ 56 ] To escape the soot of the city , many of the wealthy lived in the Shadyside and East End neighborhoods , a few miles east of downtown . Fifth Avenue was dubbed `` Millionaire 's Row '' because of the many mansions lining the street . On March 17 and 18 , 1936 , Pittsburgh suffered the worst flood in its history , with flood levels peaking at 46 feet . This catastrophe killed 69 victims , destroyed thousands of buildings , caused $ 3B ( 2006 dollars ) in damages , and put more than 60,000 steelworkers out of work . [ 57 ] High culture [ edit ] Oakland became the city 's predominant cultural and educational center , including three universities , multiple museums , a library , a music hall , and a botanical conservatory . Oakland 's University of Pittsburgh erected what today is still the world 's fourth-tallest educational building , the 42-story Cathedral of Learning . [ 58 ] It towered over Forbes Field , where the Pittsburgh Pirates played from 1909 to 1970 . [ 39 ] Downtown Pittsburgh panorama , from 1920 . New immigrants and migrants [ edit ] Between 1870 and 1920 , the population of Pittsburgh grew almost sevenfold , with a large number of European immigrants arriving to the city . New arrivals continue to come from Britain , Ireland , and Germany , but the most popular sources after 1870 were poor rural areas in southern and eastern Europe , including Italy , the Balkans , the Austro-Hungarian Empire , and the Russian Empire . Unskilled immigrants found jobs in construction , mining , steel mills and factories . They introduced new traditions , languages , and cultures to the city , creating a diversified society as a result . Ethnic neighborhoods developed in working-class areas and were built on densely populated hillsides and valleys , such as South Side , Polish Hill , Bloomfield , and Squirrel Hill , home to 28 % of the city 's almost 21,000 Jewish households . [ 59 ] The Strip District , the city 's produce distribution center , still boasts many restaurants and clubs that showcase these multicultural traditions of Pittsburghers . [ 39 ] African Americans [ edit ] Further information : Great Migration ( African American ) The years 1916–1940 marked the largest migration of African Americans to Pittsburgh during the Great Migration from the rural South to industrial cities of the Northeast and Midwest . These migrants came for industrial jobs , education , political and social freedom , and to escape racial oppression and violence in the South .
