[ 79 ] The largest college , in terms of the class of 2025 enrollment , is the College of Engineering with 499 students , followed by the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences with 391 , and the Mellon College of Science with 266 . [ 80 ] The smallest college is the School of Design , with 34 . [ 79 ] The middle 50 % range of SAT scores of enrolled freshmen was 720-770 for reading and writing , and 770-800 for math , while the middle 50 % range of the ACT composite score was 34–35 . [ 81 ] The university is need-blind for domestic applicants . [ 82 ] The class of 2026 enrolled students from 46 U.S. states and 42 countries . [ 79 ] Undergraduate tuition for 2023-2024 is $ 62,260 , and room and board is $ 17,468 . [ 83 ] Research [ edit ] Posner Hall , former home of the Tepper School of Business CMU is classified among `` R1 : Doctoral Universities – Very High Research Activity '' . [ 16 ] For the 2021 fiscal year , the university spent $ 402 million on research . The primary recipients of this funding were the School of Computer Science ( $ 100.3 million ) , the Software Engineering Institute ( $ 71.7 million ) , the College of Engineering ( $ 48.5 million ) , and the Mellon College of Science ( $ 47.7 million ) . The research money comes largely from federal sources , with a federal investment of $ 234.9 million in 2021 . The federal agencies that invest the most money include the National Science Foundation and the Department of Defense , which contributed $ 70.5 million and $ 90.4 million in 2021 , respectively . [ 84 ] The recognition of Carnegie Mellon as one of the best research facilities in the nation has a long history . As early as the 1987 federal budget , CMU was ranked as third in the amount of federal research funds received with $ 41.5 million , with only MIT and Johns Hopkins receiving more research funds from the Department of Defense . [ 85 ] The Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center ( PSC ) is a joint effort between Carnegie Mellon , University of Pittsburgh , and Westinghouse Electric Company . PSC was founded in 1986 by its two scientific directors , Ralph Roskies of the University of Pittsburgh and Michael Levine of Carnegie Mellon . PSC is a leading partner in the TeraGrid , the National Science Foundation 's cyberinfrastructure program . [ 86 ] The Scarab lunar rover is being developed by the RI . The Neuroscience Institute ( NI ) is a university-wide research institute that was founded in 2018 [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ] as a successor to an earlier effort , known as Brainhub . [ 90 ] [ 91 ] Combining research in computer science , engineering , machine learning , statistics , and cognitive science with basic neuroscience , NI aims to promote research that will improve the human condition . Devices developed by the institute have been designed to enable communication for locked-in patients , [ 92 ] treatments for Parkinson 's disease , [ 93 ] improved brain imaging technology using artificial intelligence , [ 94 ] and electrodes that work with coarse , curly hair . [ 95 ] NI includes over 30 faculty and 100 trainees from four colleges and oversees two PhD programs ( the Program in Neural Computation and the Program in Systems Neuroscience ) that have received support from the National Institutes of Health . [ 96 ] [ 97 ] Numerous philanthropic gifts help support NI research . [ 98 ] [ 99 ] [ 100 ] [ 101 ] NI also provides direct administrative and monetary support for the Center for Neural Basis of Cognition , a long-running collaboration with the University of Pittsburgh . [ 102 ] [ 103 ] The Robotics Institute ( RI ) is a division of the School of Computer Science and considered to be one of the leading centers of robotics research in the world . The Field Robotics Center ( FRC ) has developed a number of significant robots , including Sandstorm and H1ghlander , which finished second and third in the DARPA Grand Challenge , and Boss , which won the DARPA Urban Challenge . The Robotics Institute has partnered with a spinoff company , Astrobotic Technology Inc. , to land a CMU robot on the moon by 2016 in pursuit of the Google Lunar XPrize . The robot , known as Andy , is designed to explore lunar pits , which might include entrances to caves . [ 104 ] The RI is primarily sited at Carnegie Mellon 's main campus in Newell-Simon hall . [ 105 ] The Software Engineering Institute building on Fifth Avenue . The Software Engineering Institute ( SEI ) is a federally funded research and development center sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense and operated by Carnegie Mellon , with offices in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , USA and Arlington , Virginia . The SEI publishes books on software engineering for industry , government and military applications and practices . The organization is known for its Capability Maturity Model [ 106 ] [ 107 ] ( CMM ) and Capability Maturity Model Integration ( CMMI ) , which identify essential elements of effective system and software engineering processes and can be used to rate the level of an organization 's capability for producing quality systems . The SEI is also the home of CERT/CC , the federally funded computer security organization . The CERT Program 's primary goals are to support secure requirements and development of computer systems and ensure that appropriate technology and systems management practices are used to resist attacks on networked systems and to limit damage and ensure continuity of critical services subsequent to attacks , accidents , or failures .
