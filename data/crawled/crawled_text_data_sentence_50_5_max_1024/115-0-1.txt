[ 10 ] On April 15 , 1876 , Recreation Park was the site of a game between the Xanthas and the Pittsburgh Alleghenies ( alternately spelled `` Alleghenys '' [ 11 ] ) , an unrelated forerunner to the `` Alleghenys '' team which would later be renamed the Pirates . The Alleghenies won the game 7–3 . [ 12 ] The 1877 squad was the most successful yet , finishing within 1 game of the pennant in the International Association ; only a Canadian team had a better record , allowing the city potential bragging rights for being the best American team that season . 1882 marked the first `` major league '' and fully professional season for the Pittsburgh Alleghenies ( Pirates ) and in 1887 , the Alleghenies moved from American Association to the National League after owner William Nimick became frustrated over a contract dispute . [ 13 ] The Pirates were purchased in 1900 by Barney Dreyfuss , who would go down in history as the `` Father of the modern World Series '' and its precursor , the Chronicle-Telegraph Cup , both of which saw the Pirates participate in the inaugural series . He recruited Hall of Famers Fred Clarke and Pittsburgh native Honus Wagner and built the first concrete and steel ( first `` modern '' ) baseball stadium , Forbes Field . Under Dreyfuss , the Pirates won pre-World Series world titles in 1901 and 1902 , National League pennants from 1901–1903 , 1909 , 1925 and 1927 and World Series in 1909 and 1925 . The 1902 squad set major league records for winning percentage and even today is the second most winning team ever fielded in the sport . [ 14 ] The franchise won the World Series three more times— in 1960 , 1971 , and 1979 . In 1960 , the team became the first to win a World Series on a walk-off home run , hit by Bill Mazeroski , and they remain the only team to win on a walk-off homer in the decisive seventh game . In 1979 , the Pirates repeated the accomplishment of their own 1925 World Series team , coming back from a three-games-to-one deficit , winning three games in a row when facing elimination , for the title . Thus the Pirates became ( and they currently remain ) the only franchise in the history of all sports to win world titles more than once when coming back from a 3-1 deficit . The 1979 Pirates also are unique in that they are the only team in all sports to have players who captured all four MVP awards : Seasonal ( Willie Stargell , co-MVP with Keith Hernandez ) , All Star Game ( Dave Parker ) , NLCS ( Willie Stargell ) , and World Series ( Willie Stargell ) within a single season . [ 15 ] Since 1970 the team has won their division and qualified for the playoffs nine times : six in the 1970s , and three times in a row from 1990 to 1992 . Pirate players have won the league MVP award in 1960 ( Dick Groat ) , 1966 ( Roberto Clemente ) , 1978 ( Dave Parker ) , 1979 ( Willie Stargell ) , 1990 ( Barry Bonds ) , 1992 ( Barry Bonds ) , and 2013 ( Andrew McCutchen ) and the Cy Young Award in 1960 ( Vernon Law ) and 1990 ( Doug Drabek ) . In 2001 , the team opened PNC Park on the city 's North Shore , regularly ranked as one of the top three baseball parks in the country . In addition to the Pirates , the Pittsburgh Stogies , Pittsburgh Burghers and Pittsburgh Rebels played in various leagues from 1884 to 1915 . The Rebels won the pennant in 1912 and finished just a half game shy of a pennant in 1915 . [ 16 ] The Pittsburgh Keystones , Homestead Grays ( playing in the city limits ) , and Pittsburgh Crawfords played in the Negro leagues . With players including Josh Gibson and Cumberland Posey the Grays won 12 league titles—the most by any Negro
