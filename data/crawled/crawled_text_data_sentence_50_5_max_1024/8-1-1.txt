unto itselfâ€”not really southern , not really Midwestern , not really part of Pennsylvania . People just did n't move very much . [ 32 ] In his 2009 book , The Paris of Appalachia , Pittsburgh Post-Gazette writer Brian O'Neill meditates on this aspect of Pittsburgh 's regional and cultural ambiguity . The title of the book is intentionally provocative : `` The Paris of Appalachia '' some have called Pittsburgh derisively , because it 's still the largest city along this gorgeous mountain chain that needs a better press agent . I 've long felt we should embrace that title , though few are with me . Several tried to talk me out of slapping it on the cover , but were we called `` The Paris of the Rockies , '' we would n't run from it . Sometimes we 're so afraid of what others think , we 're afraid to say who we are . This city is not Midwestern . It 's not East Coast . It 's just Pittsburgh , and there 's no place like it . That 's both its blessing and its curse . [ 33 ] Arts [ edit ] Visual arts [ edit ] Greater Pittsburgh is home to several museums , galleries , and organizations which promote appreciation for the visual arts .

The first professional player ( William Heffelfinger ) played for a Pittsburgh football team in 1892 , which was followed by the first open professional ( John Brallier ) , the first all-professional team ( the Latrobe Athletic Association ) , and a participant in the first all-professional league ( the Pittsburgh Stars of the first National Football League ) . In the case of ice hockey , the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League was the first hockey league to pay its players in 1901 , eventually merging into the first fully pro league , the International Professional Hockey League , in 1904 . Professional hockey in Pennsylvania predated the professionalization of the game in Canada ( where it eventually came to dominate in the early 20th century ) by four years . Today , the region is home to three major league franchises in baseball , football , and hockey ; several minor league teams in soccer , baseball , and hockey ; and three major NCAA universities .
