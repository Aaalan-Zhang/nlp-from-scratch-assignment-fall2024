[ 16 ] The Pittsburgh Keystones , Homestead Grays ( playing in the city limits ) , and Pittsburgh Crawfords played in the Negro leagues . With players including Josh Gibson and Cumberland Posey the Grays won 12 league titles—the most by any Negro league team [ 1 ] —including nine consecutive from 1937 to 1945 . The Crawfords finished their eight-year existence with a .633 winning percentage , with a line-up including Gibson , Cool Papa Bell , and Satchel Paige and claimed four straight league titles from 1933 until 1936 , with the 1935 team judged by some [ who ? ] as the greatest one to ever take the field in the Negro leagues , or perhaps in baseball period . Just as they initially played in the first `` modern '' ballpark in the majors ( Forbes Field ) , Crawfords owner Gus Greenlee constructed the first steel and concrete `` modern '' stadium in the Negro leagues , with Greenlee Field opening in the Hill District on April 29 , 1932 . [ 17 ] Basketball [ edit ] Pittsburgh South Side won Western Pennsylvania Basketball League and Central Basketball League titles in 1904 , 1907 and 1913 , coming in second place in 1908 , 1911 and 1915 . The `` Black Fives `` league enjoyed success in the city with Monticello-Loendi winning national championships in 1912 , and four in a row from 1920–23 . The Pittsburgh Pirates from 1937–39 and Pittsburgh Raiders in 1944–45 continued professional basketball in the city in the National Basketball League . Pittsburgh had one of the founding members of what became the NBA , the Pittsburgh Ironmen however only played a single season 1947–48 before folding . The Pittsburgh Renaissance ( or Rens ) played from 1961 until 1963 in the ABL , posting the city 's best record in almost 40 years when they finished 2nd in 1962 . The most lasting legacy of pro roundball in Pittsburgh was the Pittsburgh Pipers-Pittsburgh Condors of the American Basketball Association from 1967 until 1972 . In the first ABA World Championship in 1968 , the Pipers defeated the New Orleans Buccaneers , which were owned by Harry Connick Sr. [ citation needed ] After the ABA Pipers/Condors folded in 1972 the city hosted the Pittsburgh Piranhas of the CBA in the mid-1990s . The franchise made it to the championship round in the 1994–95 season . Taking the series into the 6th game the Piranhas lost by a basket in the final seconds ( 92-94 ) by what they claimed was an ineligible player , the CBA denied a replay game in what would have been Pittsburgh 's second pro-basketball world title . [ 1 ] In the late 2000s the Pittsburgh Xplosion , a development league team owned by former NBA player Freddie Lewis , [ 18 ] played in a revamped ABA/CBA at Mellon Arena and the Petersen Events Center before ceasing operations prior to the 2008–09 season because of the economic recession . Another professional basketball team , the Pittsburgh Phantoms of the American Basketball Association , played during the 2009–10 season and held their games at the Carnegie Library of Homestead , but folded prior to the following season . Hockey [ edit ] See also : Flyers–Penguins rivalry and Sports in Philadelphia § Pittsburgh First played in Pittsburgh in 1895 , ice hockey grew in popularity after the Duquesne Gardens opened in 1899 . In 1901 the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League ( WPHL ) , a semi-professional ice hockey league based in Pittsburgh in the early 1900s , may have been involved in the first trade involving professional hockey players . In 1907 , the WPHL was the first league to openly hire hockey players . The league played its games in three Pittsburgh hockey arenas , the Gardens , the Schenley Park Casino and the Winter Garden at Exposition Hall . The Casino , which was destroyed by a fire in 1896 , had the first artificial ice surface in North America , was the first place in Pittsburgh where organized ice hockey was played and had the most modern indoor lighting system of the time era , that consisted of 1,500 incandescent lamps , 11 arc lights and 4 white calcium lights . In 1905–1907 , the city was represented in the International Professional Hockey League , the first fully professional hockey league , by the Pittsburgh Professionals . Pittsburgh Civic Arena was replaced by the venue now known as PPG Paints Arena in 2010 . The Gardens housed the largest indoor rink in the world and was home to the city 's first NHL franchise , the Pittsburgh Pirates , from 1925 to 1930 . The Gardens also was home to the Pittsburgh Shamrocks and the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets of the International Hockey League as well as the Pittsburgh Hornets of the American Hockey League . [ 19 ] In 1961 , Pittsburgh Civic Arena was constructed for use of the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera . Founded , by Jack McGregor and Peter Block as part of the 1967 NHL expansion , the Pittsburgh Penguins have played home games in downtown Pittsburgh since their inception—first at the Civic Arena , and since 2010 at PPG Paints Arena . [ 20 ] The Penguins won back-to-back Stanley Cup championships in 1991 and 1992 . The franchise recorded their third Stanley Cup in 2009 . [ 21 ] The teams included players Mark Recchi , Kevin Stevens , Jaromír Jágr , and Mario Lemieux . [ 22 ] Lemieux holds multiple franchise records and was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1997 . [ 23 ] [ 24 ] He suffered from multiple injuries , including Hodgkin 's lymphoma , throughout his career . [ 25 ] In 1999 , Lemieux purchased the Penguins and saved the franchise from bankruptcy . He returned to play one year later as the first player/owner of the modern era . [ 26 ] The Penguins , led by top point scorers Evgeni Malkin and Sidney Crosby ,
