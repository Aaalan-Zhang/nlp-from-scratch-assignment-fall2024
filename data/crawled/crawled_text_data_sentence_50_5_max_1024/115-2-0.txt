In 1902 the top players in the area , mainly from the Duquesne Country and Athletic Club line-up , formed the Pittsburgh Stars of the first National Football League . The Stars were suspected of being financed by Barney Dreyfuss and William Chase Temple , the owners of baseball 's Pittsburgh Pirates . The team featured baseball players in the line-up including Christy Mathewson , a future Hall of Fame pitcher with the New York Giants and Fred Crolius , and outfielder with Pirates . The team won the league 's only championship in 1902 . In 1933 , as the oldest of nine children Art Rooney , who had been raised on the North Side of Pittsburgh , founded the Pittsburgh Steelers . [ 30 ] Originally nicknamed the Pirates , [ 31 ] the team later changed their name to the Steelers , to represent the city 's heritage of producing steel . The Steelers ' first season with a winning record came in 1942 . However , they lost their first playoff game in 1947 . [ 32 ] In 1969 , the Steelers hired head coach Chuck Noll who strategically drafted players in order to improve the team . [ 33 ] Three years later , in the first playoff game at Three Rivers Stadium Pittsburgh 's rookie running back Franco Harris returned an errant pass that bounced off an opposing player for a game-winning touchdown in a play that later became labeled the Immaculate Reception . In 1974 , the Steelers won their first Super Bowl in franchise history—a feat which they would repeat in 1975 , 1978 , and 1979 to become the first NFL franchise to win four Super Bowls . In 1992 , Noll was succeeded by Bill Cowher , who led the franchise to its fifth Super Bowl victory in 2005 . Mike Tomlin succeeded Cower and led the Steelers to an NFL record sixth Super Bowl victory in 2008 . [ 32 ] As of 2009 , the Steelers have 18 members in the Pro Football Hall of Fame . [ 34 ] In October 1964 , Ernie Stautner , who played on the Steelers from 1950 to 1963 , became the only Steelers ' player to have his number— 70 —retired . [ 35 ] Charles `` Mean Joe '' Greene had his number -75- retired in 2014 . In 2008 , ESPN.com ranked Steelers ' fans as the best in the NFL , citing their `` unbelievable '' sellout streak of 299 consecutive games . [ 36 ] [ 37 ] Steelers Chairman Dan Rooney , son of founder Art Rooney , became the majority owner of the Steelers in November 2008 along with his son Art II , after they bought all of the shares of two of his four brothers . [ 38 ] Outside of the NFL , the city was represented by the Pittsburgh Americans of the second American Football League in 1936 and 1937 . It was also briefly represented by the Pittsburgh Maulers of the United States Football League , in 1984 , and the Pittsburgh Gladiators ( which later became the Tampa Bay Storm ) , of the Arena Football League from 1987 until 1990 . A second Arena Football League team , the Pittsburgh Power , played in the Consol Energy Center from 2011 until 2014 . [ 39 ] In addition , Pittsburgh has also been home to women 's full-contact football teams . The Pittsburgh Passion were founded in 2002 as members of the National Women 's Football Association , then played in the Independent Women 's Football League , and then Women 's Football Alliance . [ 40 ] The Passion play their home games at West Allegheny High School in nearby Imperial . The team went 12–0 and won a national title in 2007 as members of the NWFA . [ 41 ] The Pittsburgh Rebellion were members of the Legends Football League during the 2017 season with home games at the downtown Highmark Stadium . The `` most established area minor-league football team '' the Pittsburgh Colts are members of the North American Football League 's Regional American Football League . [ 42 ] [ 43 ] The United States Football League ( 2022 ) announced that the league would be relaunching in April 2022 and that the Pittsburgh Maulers would be returning [ 44 ] Soccer [ edit ] Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC are members of the USL Championship ( second division ) and play at Highmark Stadium . [ 45 ] The Riverhounds are one of the oldest professional soccer clubs in the United States operating outside of MLS ; the only two older clubs are fellow USL Championship side Charleston Battery and USL League One 's Richmond Kickers , both of which were founded in 1993 . Like their counterparts , the Steelers , Penguins and Pirates , the Riverhounds are a full-time professional club , and many of their current and former players have represented their countries in international play . In 2024 , the USL W League announced that the Riverhounds ' ownership group had established a women 's team to begin competing in 2025 . [ 46 ] Several months later , the club 's name , Pittsburgh Riveters SC , and crest were unveiled . [ 47 ] Historic teams such as the suburban Harmarville Hurricanes won the U.S. Open Cup , U.S. Soccer 's national championship , with Harmarville winning in 1952 and 1956 and reaching the final in 1953 . Pittsburgh area teams Gallatin and Morgan Strasser also won the Open Cup in its earlier years , but since the end of the 1950s , only the Riverhounds have advanced as far as the quarterfinals , which they achieved in 2001 and 2023 . The amateur club Pittsburgh Beadling has contested for regional and national titles for over 100 years , winning the National Amateur Cup in 1954 , [ 48 ] though Beadling now operates primarily as a youth club .
