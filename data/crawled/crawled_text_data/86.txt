EVENT WEBSITE
Join the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust to celebrate Día de Los Muertos with a series of vibrant and meaningful events to honor the beauty of this cultural tradition with food, music, film, and community engagement.

Aimed at an international audience—and indeed, it was the first Mexican film to be nominated for an Academy Award, as well as Mexico’s entry in the 1960 Cannes Film Festival—Macario takes the form of a macabre fable about an impoverished peasant (Ignacio López Tarso) who dreams of having enough food to satisfy his constant hunger.

Macario’s life takes a dramatic turn when he encounters three mysterious figures representing Death (played by José Gálvez), the Devil (played by Enrique Lucero), and God (played by Pina Pellicer). They offer him a gift: a magical turkey that will grant him three wishes. In exchange, Macario must promise to give the bones of the turkey to Death. P With his newfound ability to fulfill his desires, Macario embarks on a journey filled with moral dilemmas and consequences. He uses his wishes to satisfy his hunger and improve his social status but soon realizes that wealth and power do not bring him true happiness. As he grapples with the consequences of his choices, Macario learns profound lessons about greed, compassion, and the nature of human existence.

Homefront and Frontlines: Women and the Impact of War

EVENT WEBSITE
Join the History Center and the Veterans Breakfast Club for a storytelling event honoring the strength and sacrifice of women during war time, from the battlefield to the home front.

Hear firsthand accounts from veterans and military families who will share their personal journeys of how military life has shaped their identities and their lives.

This program is not just about listening – it’s also about sharing. We encourage attendees to share their stories and unique perspectives on their life experiences.

The “Homefront and Frontlines: Women and the Impact of War” program is held in conjunction with the History Center’s new exhibition, A Woman’s Place: How Women Shaped Pittsburgh. The exhibit recognizes that military action and times of conflict have always been a double-edged sword for women, bringing sacrifice and loss but also opportunities for them to learn new skills, demonstrate untapped abilities, and enter previously inaccessible spaces closed to them during peacetime.

Whether soldier or civilian, military service has always required from women a complicated balancing act, managing the needs of home, family, work, and service, while supporting a loved one away on duty, or increasingly in the modern era, taking on that role themselves.
