Named after U.S. Senator H. John Heinz III (1938–1991) from Pennsylvania, it is located in the Strip District of Pittsburgh . The Heinz History Center is a 275,000-square-foot (25,500 m 2 ) [ 2 ] educational institution "that engages and inspires a diverse audience with links to the past, understanding in the present, and guidance for the future by preserving regional history and presenting the American experience with a Western Pennsylvania connection." [ 3 ] In 2024, the Heinz History Center was named the best history museum in America by readers of USA Today as part of their annual Readers' Choice poll. [ 4 ] Senator John Heinz History Center [ edit ] This museum's history began in 1879, with the formation of a club called Old Residents of Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania. In 1884, leaders changed the organization's name to the Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania (HSWP); it has been operating continuously since then and is the Pittsburgh region's oldest cultural organization. [ 3 ] HSWP began the tradition of interpreting public history in 1911, organizing the centennial of steamboat navigation in Pittsburgh. In 1955, it led the organization of the city's bicentennial celebration. During its early years, HSWP leaders held meetings in homes and churches, but in 1893, were granted space for the organization's archives at the new Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh in the Oakland neighborhood. [ 3 ] By 1914, HSWP had its own building on Bigelow Boulevard. It operated there until 1996, when its expanded quarters in the renovated historic warehouse were completed in Pittsburgh's Strip District . [ 3 ] The Society celebrated the opening of the new museum by hosting an inaugural gala there on April 26, 1996, for 900 guests. [ citation needed ] In 2004, the Smithsonian wing was completed, adding a gallery for changing exhibitions from the Smithsonian Institution , a Special Collections Gallery, an Education Center, and the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum.
