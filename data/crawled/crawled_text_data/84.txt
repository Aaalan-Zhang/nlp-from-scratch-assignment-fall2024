Kim Bond: We Are Not Alone
Sep 6, 2024 - Jan 12, 2025
707 Gallery
707 Penn Avenue
Pittsburgh, PA 15222
EVENT WEBSITE
For nearly four decades, Kim Bond (b. 1963, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) has explored the intersections of paranormal phenomena and the pursuit of a kinder, more inclusive world through her multidisciplinary practice encompassing drawings, paintings, sculptures, and writings. Bond's oeuvre is characterized by the integration of extraterrestrial imagery, including aliens, spacecraft, and Sasquatch, into natural environments such as the Colorado Mountains, Niagara Falls, Lake Erie, and Mt. St. Helena. These entities, with whom Bond professes communication, are depicted in tranquil landscapes, symbolizing hope and moral integrity. Another series depicts “The Rainbow Club,” Bond's vision for a utopian social venue that welcomes all beings, transcending barriers of gender, ability, age, and even species. In a fragmented society, Bond's work envisions a harmonious realm where diversity is not only accepted but celebrated.
Bond initially honed her artistic skills and developed her unique aesthetic language through exposure to The Joy of Painting, a groundbreaking instructional television program created by Bob Ross that aired from 1983 to 1994 on PBS. The Joy of Painting democratized access to arts education, including individuals with disabilities. Airing on public television, the show allowed people to learn how to paint from their homes, eliminating both cost barriers and the need for physical attendance in classes. Ross’ simple, encouraging instruction and adaptive tools and techniques made painting approachable for everyone, regardless of skill level or physical ability. The flexible viewing format and his philosophy of “no mistakes, only happy accidents” further promoted creativity and individual expression, breaking down barriers and highlighting the inclusive power of art.
Since 2018, Bond has been a resident artist at VaultArt Studio, a progressive arts organization that supports and promotes the inclusion of artists with disabilities in contemporary art by providing professional-level arts instruction in a supportive studio environment. Bond’s affiliation with VaultArt Studio has allowed her to further develop and professionalize her artistic practice, engage with a diverse community of artists, and continue to advocate for inclusivity through her work. Her contributions to the studio and the broader community exemplify her commitment to creating a world where differences are embraced and celebrated.

Roger Jacoby: Pittsburgh Stories
Oct 25, 2024 - Jan 5, 2025
Wood Street Galleries
601 Wood St
Pittsburgh, PA 15222
EVENT WEBSITE
Wood Street Galleries is pleased to present the world premiere of three newly restored experimental films by Roger Jacoby (b. New York, 1944–1985), a pivotal figure bridging the pre- and post-liberation eras of gay experimental filmmaking. This exhibition is the inaugural project in a series of exhibitions and programs dedicated to historic artists who have created significant work in, about, or influenced by the city of Pittsburgh, specifically in the field of time-based or experimental media.
Roger Jacoby's career as a filmmaker spanned from 1972 until his untimely death from AIDS in 1985, during which he completed eight films—all produced in Pittsburgh. Originally trained as a painter and classical pianist, Jacoby's artistic journey took a transformative turn through his work as a gallery assistant for his aunt, Rose Fried. This role introduced him to New York’s vibrant artistic circles, including Andy Warhol’s Factory, where he met his long-time partner, the Warhol Superstar Ondine. Encouraged by filmmaker Marie Menken, who gifted him his first film camera, Jacoby began experimenting with film around 1970. Seeking a change in environment, he and Ondine relocated to Pittsburgh in 1972, where Jacoby found a job playing piano for silent films at the Carnegie Museum of Art. There, he connected with Sally Dixon, the museum’s pioneering Film Department founder, who introduced him to the Pittsburgh Filmmakers, then based at the Selma Burke Art Center, a key gathering place for local artists.
Jacoby’s approach to filmmaking was both practical and deeply personal. He began processing his film footage in his own bathroom, using his bathtub as a makeshift darkroom. Even after receiving a National Endowment for the Arts grant in 1972 to acquire more advanced equipment, Jacoby continued hand-processing his films, embracing the unique, handcrafted qualities that became the hallmark of his work.
Over the past three years, The Berkely Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive have meticulously transferred and restored a selection of Jacoby's early films, with support from the Avant-Garde Masters Grants awarded by The Film Foundation and the National Film Preservation Foundation.
On view at Wood Street Galleries from October 2024 through January 2025 are Dream Sphinx Opera (1973) and L’Amico Fried’s Glamorous Friends (1976), which showcase Jacoby's innovative use of hand-processing techniques to manipulate film emulsion, resulting in striking abstract imagery. These films feature appearances by Sally Dixon and Ondine, along with other members of Pittsburgh's art and film communities, set against backdrops that include Phipps Conservatory, Carnegie Music Hall, the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, and various domestic spaces, including Jacoby’s own apartment on Walnut Street in Shadyside. Also on view will be How to Be a Homosexual Part I (1980), in which Jacoby turns his camera on his own community. This film captures intimate portraits of his sister and mother, a deaf friend, and a gay couple from the Gay Activist Alliance, revealing the personal and communal aspects of Jacoby's work.
These films, marked by Jacoby's characteristic blending of avant-garde techniques and personal narrative, offer a compelling window into the life and artistic vision of a filmmaker whose work remains a vital part of Pittsburgh's cultural legacy.
