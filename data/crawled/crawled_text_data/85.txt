PHLF docents are on hand to tell you the story of the former Allegheny County Jail. Completed in 1886 to the designs of Boston architect H. H. Richardson, it closed on July 27, 1995.

Working with the leadership of Allegheny County and with funding from the Drue Heinz Trust, our organization coordinated with the former jail’s Deputy Warden Ed Urban and the Allegheny County Juvenile Court to preserve one portion of the cell blocks of the historic jail to create the Old Allegheny County Jail Museum.
The Jail Museum, which is located in Downtown— at 440 Ross Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15219— opened in 2005.

This November, Heinz Hall is transformed into a symphony of sight, taste, and splendor! From Bavarian beer halls to the high peaks of the Alps, take a "Walk on the Wild Side," AKA our very own Novemberfest inspired by Strauss's sublime An Alpine Symphony.
First, join us for the pre-show party around Heinz Hall. Enjoy a glass of Bavarian beer or a specialty cocktail from the Biergarten, explore music-themed activities, take photos, and mingle with fellow guests before heading into this short (but epic) performance.
An Alpine Symphony is a single-movement piece with 22 phases that runs just around 50 minutes. Over 100 musicians are required to bring Strauss's transcendental tone poem to life: a journey through the fierce elements, apparitions, and mysteries of nature. Listen for stormy winds, echoes of thunder in the distance, birdcalls, and a triumphant summit.
It's awe-inspiring. You can't help but smile. You'll wish you brought your hiking shoes.

An adulterous double feature

Jealousy, two-timing, and revenge unite the back-to-back tragedies of Cavalleria Rusticana and Pagliacci. Possessiveness, machismo, and rage fuel their bloody conclusions.

Pagliacci: Just before a performance of his traveling circus troupe, clown Canio discovers the infidelity of his wife Nedda.

Join us for this back-to-back double feature of love and hate—the first time Pittsburgh Opera has performed these two operas together since 1996!
