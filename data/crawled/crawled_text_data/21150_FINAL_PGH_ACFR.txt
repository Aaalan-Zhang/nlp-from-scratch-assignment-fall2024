Lamb     414 G RANT  STREET  | CITY-COUNTY  BUILDING , FIRST  FLOOR  | 412 255 2054   Friday, April 28, 2023     To the Honorable Mayor, Members of City Council, and the Citizens of the City of Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania:     I am pleased to present the  Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR) of the City of Pittsburgh  (City) for the year ended December 31, 2022. The City’s charter mandates that only a general -purpose  financial statement be issued by May 1. This does not include component units; stat ements mandated  under Governmental Account Standards Board (GASB), Statement 34; footnotes; and the statistical  section. This year, we are issuing a full ACFR on April 28, 2023, which meets the Government Finance  Officers Association (GFOA) standards and a llows the City to get an unmodified opinion from the City’s  independent auditors.     We believe that the enclosed data is accurate in all material respects and fairly presents both the financial  position and operational results of the City’s various funds. T his statement will enable the reader to gain  an understanding of the City’s financial activities. Responsibility for both the accuracy of data and the  completeness and fairness of the presentation rests with the management of the City. This report contains   all the funds of the City.     Maher Duessel Certified Public Accountants have issued an unmodified (i.e., “clean”) opinion on the  City’s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022. This independent auditor’s report is  located in front of the Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A).     The MD&A immediately follows the independent auditor’s report and provides a narrative introduction,  overview, and analysis of the basic financial statements. The MD&A complements this letter of transmittal  and should be read in conjunction with it.     PROFILE OF THE GOVERNMENT     The City, incorporated in 1816, is located in the southwestern part of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania  (Pennsylvania) occupying 55.37 square miles with a population of 302,971 according to the 2020 Census.  Although ranked as the 68th most populous City in the country, the City is still considered more densely  populated than five of the top ten populous cities due to its population density of 5,469 people per square  mile. This is primarily  because the City limits have remained virtually unchanged for nearly a century. (1)  The City government is comprised of a strong elected mayor, a nine -member Council elected by district,  and an elected Controller. The Mayor is the chief executive of the C ity who appoints the heads of various  departments, and the Council has the legislative authority. (2) The Mayor is elected to a four -year term  and the Council members are elected to staggered four -year terms in which the even -numbered districts       414 G RANT  STREET  | CITY-COUNTY  BUILDING , FIRST  FLOOR  | 412 255 2054     are elected  in one year and the odd -numbered districts are elected two years later. (3) The Controller audits  City government -related expenditures and conducts audits of all City departments and authorities. (4) Like  the Mayor, the Controller is elected to a four -year term. The City is empowered to levy a variety of taxes  including property taxes on real estate, earned income taxes on residents that live within the boundaries  of the City, and other usage taxes charged when using certain facilities within the City. In addition, the  City levies taxes on employees that work within the City and on businesses that operate within the City.  Please see the revenue section in this letter for a more detailed explanation of the taxes collected.     The City provides a full range of services, including police, fire, and emergency medical services;  construction and maintenance of City property and infrastructure; sanitation services; and recreation and  cultural activities. The Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA), Urban Redevelo pment Authority  (URA), Stadium Authority, and Pittsburgh Parking Authority are component units of the City and are  shown as such in the financial statements and the footnotes to the ACFR.     The Council is required to adopt a final operating and capital budg et for the next year by the last day of  the fiscal year, which is December 31. The annual budget is the basis of the City’s financial planning and  control. The operating budget is prepared on a departmental basis. The department heads may spend within  a budget classification (e.g., salaries, supplies, rentals, miscellaneous) as they see fit. However, any  transfers between classifications or departments have to be approved by Council. The Mayor’s Office also  prepares a five -year plan annually.     FINANCIAL INFORMATION     The Financial Information is broken down into two categories: Internal Control and Budget Control, which  are explained in further detail below.     Internal Control: Management of the City is responsible for establishing and maintaining an intern al  control structure designed to ensure that the assets of the City are protected from loss, theft, or misuse and  to ensure that adequate accounting information is compiled to prepare financial statements in accordance  with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S.). The internal control  structure is designed to provide reasonable but not absolute assurance that these objectives are met. The  concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that: (1) the cost of a control shoul d not exceed the benefits  likely to be derived and (2) the evaluation of costs and benefits requires estimates and judgments by  management.     Budget Control: Budget control is maintained at the line -item level on a departmental basis. Activities of  the Gene ral Fund, the Special Revenue Fund (Community Development Fund only), and the Capital  Projects Fund are controlled by an annual legally appropriated budget. Capital Projects are also controlled  on a multiyear basis.     ECONOMIC CONDITION     Located at the conf luence of the Ohio, Monongahela, and Allegheny Rivers, the City serves as the seat  for Allegheny County and is the largest of the County’s 130 municipalities. Downtown Pittsburgh is       414 G RANT  STREET  | CITY-COUNTY  BUILDING , FIRST  FLOOR  | 412 255 2054     commonly known as the Golden Triangle and serves as the regional center fo r Southwestern Pennsylvania,  Eastern Ohio, and Northern West Virginia.     ECONOMIC BACKGROUND     While the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic began to morph into an endemic as vaccines  and boosters became readily available, the virus’s economic impac t was still felt in 2022. The City itself  was buoyed by the support of the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), but the regional economy is likely  dealing with the permanent changes as a result of the pandemic, including changes to the workforce and  population  loss.      Despite a regional economy weakened by COVID -19, City finances in 2022 remained stable. With the  help of ARPA, the City exceeded budget projections and collected more than $700 million into the General  Fund. Parking tax revenue continues to slowl y recover from the pandemic; in 2022, we brought in $46  million showing notable improvement over our $28 million lows in 2020 and 2021. The Amusement tax  continues to rebound, too, far exceeding budget projections and bringing in $16.8 million.      The City  received its second $167 million ARPA deposit in June 2022; ARPA support totaled $335 million  (the first half arrived in 2021). A transfer of $48 million went to the General Fund along with a $20 million  deposit to the Capital Projects Fund. General Fund monies allowed the City to restore many vacant  positions originally slated for elimination, maintain current compensation levels to prevent layoffs, and  facilitate worker retention incentives, such as reasonable pay increases. Collectively, these funds ens ured  the continuation of services provided to City residents. Capital projects funded by ARPA in 2022 included  upgrades to our green fleet, demolition of City -owned property, and investments into City sidewalks and  steps. Monies were also deposited in two new grant  sub -funds. The first was $250,000 to the Lead Safety  Fund to mitigate the exposure to lead hazards by City residents, in particular young children, for lead  testing and/or remediation. This was the first transfer to this fund out of a total ARPA  allocation of $2  million. In response to Fern Hollow Bridge Collapse, $1.8 million was transferred to a newly created  Bridge Asset Management Fund to focus directly on the safety, integrity, and funding for the maintenance  of the City’s bridges.     The City  signed a $17 million cooperative agreement (co -op) with the PWSA for Lead Service Line  Replacement. A payment of $2,209,891 went to the PWSA on December 15, 2022. The City’s ARPA  funds were also directed to the URA. The City signed six co -op agreements wi th the URA in 2022 totaling  $28 million and advanced funds of $8.775 million and reimbursed funds of $1.1 million for projects like  Penn Circle Two -Way Conversion, Casa San José Immigration Court Program, “Streeteries” Grants  (Restaurant Outdoor Dining Inf rastructure), the Jasmine Nyree Center, and OWNPGH Affordable  Homeownership Program. An additional contract, signed with the URA in 2022, is for the Downtown  Commercial Real Estate Conversion Project, though funds have not yet transferred. While initial  allocations of ARPA funds were made in 2021, City Council and the new Mayor reallocated certain funds  in 2022.     The new Bridge Asset Management Fund was created in the wake of the Fern Hollow Bridge Collapse on  January 28, 2022 in Frick Park. City and Count y leaders surveying the scene were joined by President Joe       414 G RANT  STREET  | CITY-COUNTY  BUILDING , FIRST  FLOOR  | 412 255 2054     Biden, who was visiting the City the day of the collapse to promote the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs  Act.     Within weeks, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation announced that $25.3 mi llion in federal  funds would be allocated to replacing the Fern Hollow Bridge as a state project. Construction began in the  summer of 2022, and the replacement bridge was opened to traffic in late December.     The bridge collapse highlighted the backlog of critical infrastructure repairs faced by the City. A  December 2022 report on the condition of the 147 City -owned bridges found that four were in “Very  Good” condition, 12 in “Good” condition, 14 in “Satisfactory” condition, 54 in “Fair” condition, and 32  in “Poor Condition.” In response, the City administration announced the creation of a Bridge Asset  Management Program to develop a comprehensive plan to meet those needs. While increases in federal  funding have allowed the City to focus on repairs for top -priority bridges, closing the backlog completely  will require long -term fiscal commitments and close partnerships with state and federal administrators.     As mentioned in this letter last year, the ARPA funds represent a rare fiscal opportunity for the City . The  City has until December 31, 2024 to encumber all $335 million allocated and until the end of 2026 to  spend it. Funds must be directed toward COVID -19 response and the public health impacts thereof;  premium pay for essential workers; offsetting revenu e loss caused by the pandemic; and necessary  investments in water, sewer, or broadband infrastructure. While the City’s Office of Management and  Budget maintains responsibility for federal compliance with the U.S. Department of Treasury, the City  Controlle r’s Office has and will continue to audit the American Rescue Plan Trust Fund annually until its  depletion along with specific projects using money from this account.     Diversifying revenue streams must be a top priority for the City. As mentioned earlier, parking usage is  slowly returning, but it has become increasingly evident that the downtown commuter model, which  benefitted the City through the parking tax, is unlikely to return to pre -pandemic levels. The City relies  too heavily on revenue derived from  its residents, including wage, deed transfer, and real estate taxes, and  we must pursue different avenues for revenue.      In 2022, the City Controller’s Office released a joint report with the Allegheny County Controller’s Office  analyzing revenues lost b y local municipalities to tax -exempt properties owned by the region’s largest  nonprofits. The report found that the five largest nonprofits own $4.3 billion in tax -exempt property in the  City alone, reducing their cumulative tax bill by nearly 93%. If not exempt, these institutions would owe  $34.5 million in real estate taxes annually.     While the region has undoubtedly benefitted from a nonprofit model centered on these “eds and meds”  the growth of these institutions has also taken an increasing share of p roperties off the tax rolls, putting  strain on City finances. As of 2022, around 20% of all property in the City was owned by nonprofits, 63%  of which belonged to the five largest nonprofits.     The report recommended that City leaders reprioritize “payment -in-lieu of taxes” (PILOT) agreements  with these institutions as compensation for essential public services used by all organizations in the City,  like critical infrastructure and emergency services. Doing so would ensure long -term, stable sources of  reven ue to help the city offset post -pandemic declines in other revenue sources.        414 G RANT  STREET  | CITY-COUNTY  BUILDING , FIRST  FLOOR  | 412 255 2054       Recently available labor data from 2022 on these “eds and meds” demonstrates that these sectors have not  yet fully bounced back from the pandemic. Employment was down 13% in nursi ng and residential care  facilities in late 2022 compared to the same time in 2019. Comparatively, hospital employment was down  11% and the healthcare and social assistance sectors were down 7%.     In the broader labor market at the end of 2022, the area’s u nemployment rate was at 4%, which is the  lowest it has been since 1976 when the state Department of Labor & Industry began to record the statistic.  This 4% matched the unemployment rate across the state in the fall, which was also the lowest recorded.   While the economy continued to open up, hiring remained very difficult in western Pennsylvania. This  followed the 2021 news that our labor market had shrunk to levels not seen in decades. In 2022, the region  was 5% behind the national average of pandemic job loss recovery; the national economy reached a  recovery rate of 101%, while Pennsylvania continued to lag at 96%. The region did add 24,000 new jobs  in 2022, which outpaced seven of the region’s 15 benchmark cities.     The City’s metropolitan region continued  to lose population in 2022. While this drop was lower than that  in 2021, it was also the second highest on record, accounting for a regional population decline of over  17,500 people. Notably, this population loss would have been even more severe if not fo r a rebound in  international migration into the region; immigration into the region in 2022 was the fifth highest on record,  bringing in 3,393 immigrants.      The City ranks low in lists that measure the percentage of foreign -born residents. In growth -heavy  Seattle,  20% of residents were born abroad, as compared to 4.1% in the City. This is also concerning when  reflecting on the City’s long history of welcoming immigrants as an engine of economic growth: in 1910,  more than 25% of the City residents were fore ign-born.     Unfortunately, that rebound in migration was heavily outweighed by a combination of outmigration and  deaths exceeding births. These demographic changes reflect broader national migration shifts toward the  Southeast and West, as well as an aging  population, both of which will continue to hinder efforts to  accelerate growth in the city. In the present, maintaining a welcoming environment for immigrants and  retaining recent graduates will be key to mitigating and reversing Pittsburgh’s ongoing tren d of population  loss.    Shifts downtown are also indicating that COVID -19-related changes are here to stay. Forty -four new  projects have brought nearly 8,400 new residents downtown over the last decade. While we are seeing  telework become more and more perm anent among many sectors —which is impacting the downtown  commuter population in a real way —our downtown residents are increasing year after year. By 2022, the  Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership estimates that more than 20,000 people are living downtown and in   neighboring areas, with the downtown resident population estimated to have increased 4% since 2021.  Nearly 900 new units were added in the Golden Triangle in 2022 and the occupancy rate has increased  from 86.1% in spring 2021 to 91.9% in fall 2022.     The City’s real estate market remains stable. While the market has cooled slightly in 2022, the number of  homes available for sale in western Pennsylvania remained low, likely due to scarcity of inventory and  homeowners who secured low interest rates in the pr eceding decade. City homes are taking longer to sell       414 G RANT  STREET  | CITY-COUNTY  BUILDING , FIRST  FLOOR  | 412 255 2054     than suburban homes, but according to the West Penn Multi -List, on average, homes in Allegheny County  sold for 95% of their original price listing price in 2022. It is worth noting that at the end of 202 2, home  loan applications were at their lowest level since 1996 as a result of the Federal Reserve’s ongoing rate  hikes, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.     In 2022, the City ascended from 30th to 18th place on the rankings of Best Places to Li ve in America, per  the ranking and review company Niche. Factors used in Niche’s rankings include affordability, local  housing markets, neighborhood diversity, schools, and walkability. Data is compiled from the U.S.  Census, the Federal Bureau of Investiga tion (FBI), the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention (CDC), and millions of resident reviews.     The Port Authority of Allegheny County underwent a name change in 2022 and is now known as  Pittsburgh Regional Transit (PR T). Ridership is still down considerably from pre -pandemic levels:  average weekday bus ridership was down 41% when comparing May 2022 to May 2019. The federal  COVID -19 relief funds have allowed the PRT to maintain current routes in the short -term.      New developments in the City for 2022 include the start of construction of the First National Bank (FNB)  Financial Center, located on 1.25 acres of existing parking lots near PPG Paints Arena. The nearly 500,000  square feet, 26 -story mixed -use tower is sla ted to be the City’s 16th tallest building overall, and the second  tallest building constructed in the City in the 21st century. The anchor tenant will be First National Bank  Corp, the parent company of First National Bank, who will use this as their corporate headquarters site.  The tower is the first piece of a massive 28 -acre, $350 million redevelopment plan known as the  Lower  Hill Redevelopment. The tower is expected to generate 1,250 construction jobs, 2,000 permanent jobs,  and $40 million in investments in the Middle and Upper Hill District.       Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT) finished 2022 by servicing 8.1 mill ion passengers, up about 28%  from the 6.3 million passengers it saw in 2021, but with only 83% of the volume it had from 2019's  passenger totals of 9.8 million people. Cargo operations at PIT, which have declined for several months  in a row, finished 2022 down 11.9% with 219.7 million pounds being moved across PIT's runways during  the year, compared to the 249.4 million pounds PIT moved in 2021.     Despite industry headwinds, airline executives expressed optimism that the travel industry will prove more  resilient than in prior crises, due to demand outstripping supply. To that end, PIT had added, resumed, or  increased numerous routes, both domestically and internationally, throughout 2022. It welcomed back its   direct, non -stop international flights to and fro m London’s Heathrow Airport on British Airways, in  addition to seeing Air Canada resume daily flights to Montreal for the summer. PIT also bolstered its West  Coast service by providing additional connectivity of Pittsburgh’s tech economy, including the res toration  of United’s daily flights to San Fransisco and Alaska Airlines’ additional daily flight to Seattle. PIT also  increased its ultra low -cost carrier (ULCC) portfolio with the inclusion of Sun Country Airlines’ seasonal  service to Minneapolis. Sun Cou ntry is one of five ULCCs serving the Pittsburgh market along with  Allegient, Breeze, Frontier, and Spirit.      PIT is undergoing a $1.5 billion modernization and renovation project including a new terminal and multi - modal complex that is slated to open in 2025. As the terminal takes shape, a new milestone was reached  in the fall of 2022 with the installation of 100 -ton, locally fabricated steel girders. They are part of the       414 G RANT  STREET  | CITY-COUNTY  BUILDING , FIRST  FLOOR  | 412 255 2054     16,000 tons of steel placed to date which are secured by over 182,000 bolts and 9.5 miles of welds. The  32 million pounds of steel were fabricated locally in Ambridge, and 80% of the contracts awarded have  been with local Pittsburgh firms. No tax dollars are being used for PIT construction, and it will instead be  funded by parking, conces sions, and the airlines. A $20 million grant from the federal bipartisan  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act was awarded toward phase one of the new terminal project. In  December 2022, the Richard King Mellon Foundation announced an $2 million grant for  the new terminal.  The funds will go towards building natural landscaping in the four outdoor terraces. The terraced parks  will have walking trails and gardens with native species.     Our three rivers are a defining feature to the City. Today, the region’s r ivers and streams suffer, due in  part to the frequent overflows of raw sewage from the region’s wastewater system. Expanding pavement  and rooftops from new developments, as well as intense rainfall have continued to place strain on this  system.     The Alleg heny County Sanitary Authority (ALCOSAN) and the municipalities it serves have developed  plans that will begin to address the problem of sewage overflows. ALCOSAN settled a water pollution  lawsuit filed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) by signing a legally binding consent  decree in 2008 to address sewage pollution in Allegheny County’s waterways.     In 2012, ALCOSAN presented a $2.5 billion plan to construct miles of underground tunnels designed to  capture billions of gallons of combined stor m and sewer overflows from municipal lines to the ALCOSAN  plant. Although comprehensive and potentially the biggest public works project in the history of the  region, the public challenged ALCOSAN to make the plan more affordable for ratepayers, yet flexib le  enough to take advantage of advances in the field of green stormwater and wastewater management. In  order to meet those requests, further negotiations were necessary and continued.     In May 2020, ALCOSAN announced that its Modified Consent Decree (with the U.S. Department of  Justice, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental  Protection, and the Allegheny County Health Department) had been approved.     The Modified Consent Decree allows:     1. ALCOSAN to continue forw ard with its Clean Water Plan, a blueprint for reducing seven billion  gallons of overflows from flowing into local rivers and streams,   2. An extended time frame in which ALCOSAN must implement its Clean Water Plan, and   3. ALCOSAN to propose future amendments to  the Clean Water Plan, which might include replacing  some proposed control technologies with green infrastructure controls.     Despite the challenging state of the economy and increasing inflation in 2022, the City’s technology  ecosystem showed continued str ength and impressive resilience, as 167 unique Pittsburgh tech companies  attracted $1.029 billion of the $1.05 billion total investments made across 176 deals. This was a significant  increase over the $894 million invested in the City’s technology companie s in 2021, as venture capital,  being the primary component of the year’s investment totals, was up 21% from 2021 with a record number  of deals in 2022.          414 G RANT  STREET  | CITY-COUNTY  BUILDING , FIRST  FLOOR  | 412 255 2054     A common metric used to measure total investments in the City’s tech economy is a three -year trailing  average of investment totals, which in the past decade has grown 241%. In addition, the number of  investment rounds in 2022 demonstrates that the City’s tech economy continues to attract investment in  an increasing number of local companies, with 171 such r ounds. Investment activity championed such  sectors as life sciences and software. For the first time since 2017, the life sciences and software sectors  combined to drive more investment activity than in that of local hardware and robotics sectors. Total  investment in the life sciences sector has increased by 193% over the past ten years, and the software  sector has grown by 621% in the same period. Such significant sector growth across the varying sectors  is a positive indicator that even when historically leading sectors such as robotics and hardware experience  a tough year, the rest of the City’s tech economy can keep up the momentum.     Over the past few years, several new funds at Pittsburgh -based venture capital firms have emerged. These  include 412 Venture Fund, Blue Tree Capital Group, Black Tech Nation Ventures, Magaras Venture  Partners, RFK Mellon Social Impact Fund, Reinforced Vent ures, The Midwest Fund, and The Fund XX.  Several of these funds also announced closings in 2022. Two new funds launched in 2022, including a  $50 million fund by Dick Sporting Goods to support sports technology, and a $5 billion technology fund  raised by lo cal billionaire Thomas Tull, of which $1.3 billion had already closed in November.     Technology hubs attract world -class investors, and, thus, the City’s companies continue to draw the  attention of leading venture capital firms, including New Enterprise Ass ociate, Sequoiak Tiger Global,  Kleiner Perkins, and Index Ventures. Additionally, the corporate arms of Toyota, Ford, BMW, and  Samsung have all invested here. The year 2022 saw a significant increase in uncommitted funds at  Pittsburgh -based venture firms, with $127 million, up from $74 million in 2021, over 300 unique venture  capital firms, angel groups, and strategic investors have made investments in the City’s companies in the  past five years, including a record 74 firms that made their first investment in the region in 2022.     Nationally, 2022 saw fewer exits and IPOs compared to 2021, yet the City featured 27 exits with disclosed  values of over $1.9 billion. This is an increase from the 20 exits in 2021, albeit 2021’s disclosed value  total was over $6.5 billion. Since the specific terms of many deals are never disclosed, the total value of  exit proceeds is larger than the disclosed value; thus, the volume of 2022’s exits is significant considering  the economic headwinds experienced nationwide.      Exits ty pically occur in the form of an outright purchase, merger, or acquisition of a start -up by a larger  company. Each successful exit strengthens the regional tech ecosystem by providing capital back to  venture capitalists, business angels, and overall investo rs as a return on their original investment. With  each exit, investors realize a positive return and are more likely to invest in the region again. Other  investors learn of these successes and thereby consider the City as a more attractive investment desti nation.  In addition, the founders and employees receive windfall gains and may become angel investors or  mentors, along with being financially well -positioned to pursue new ventures themselves. The volume of  exits, along with the startups, serves as a metr ic for the growth and vitality of the local investment  environment. Thus, increased deal activity creates an ongoing cycle within the entrepreneurial community.     As global firms acquire local startups, it is often the catalyst for larger firms to establish  permanent offices  in the City. Amazon, Aptiv, Bosch, Facebook, IBM, Microsoft, NetApp, Philips, Smith & Nephew, and  Proofpoint are all examples of large tech firms with a significant and growing local presence as a result of       414 G RANT  STREET  | CITY-COUNTY  BUILDING , FIRST  FLOOR  | 412 255 2054     startup acquisitions. This oft en further attracts satellite offices of global companies, such as Alphabet,  Facebook, Bayer, Affirm, and Berkshire Grey.     Nationally, Pittsburgh continues to compete effectively. In 2022, according to Morningstar’s PitchBook  Financial Database, the Pittsb urgh region (i.e., Pittsburgh, New Castle, Weirton, PA -OH-WV) ranked 24th  in population, 14th in deals per million residents, and 21st in the total number of funding rounds in the past  10 years. Additionally, the City ranked 23rd among the 40 most populous  metropolitan areas in dollars  invested per capita in 2022 and 19th in total dollars invested over the past 10 years.     The year 2022 was another record year for non -dilutive funding (i.e., grants), which fund innovation  without diluting investors or founde rs. Local research universities attracted over $11 billion in research  funding in the past decade, with over $1.5 billion in 2022, up $120 million from 2021. Carnegie Mellon  University and the University of Pittsburgh consistently rank among the top recipi ents of National  Instituters of Health (NIH) funding, with 2022 being a record year for total research budgets at each. In  fact, the University of Pittsburgh’s total research budget surpassed $1 billion, while Carnegie Mellon  University’s research budget t otaled $465 million across the Software Engineering Institute in addition to  the Advanced Robotics for Manufacturing Institute. Overall, the City’s non -dilutive research budgets have  grown steadily, up 47% over the past decade.     Additionally, in 2022 the r egion was awarded a $62.7 million federal Build Back Better grant as part of  the $1 billion allocated by President Biden’s Build Back Better challenge. The funding will be divided  between five regional projects designed to promote the region’s robotic and autonomy industries, which  are being led by tech leaders including the Advanced Robotics for Manufacturing Institute, Innovation  Works, and InnovatePGH.     The City’s local research universities experienced a 104% increase in the number of patents issued in the  past ten years. Although the number of patents issued in 2022 decreased from the record level achieved  in 2021, the number of licenses, options and other agreements created increased by 24% from 2021.  Furthermore, the number of new spinout companies ha s increased 5%, and the number of investment  disclosures, which serves as a leading indicator of patent and license activity, increased by 15%. This  ramped up activity at the front end of the commercialization pipeline bodes well for entrepreneurial effort s  in the coming years.     Accolades from major players regarding the investment potential of Pittsburgh’s technology environment  display the confidence investors feel, and include the following:     "Agot is proud to call Pittsburgh home, and we have benefited greatly from the deep and diverse local  talent pool as well as a supportive community that values innovation and collaboration. We believe  Pittsburgh will continue to grow as a tech hub and are excited to be a part of that journey."   Evan DeSantola   Agot CEO          414 G RANT  STREET  | CITY-COUNTY  BUILDING , FIRST  FLOOR  | 412 255 2054     "Pittsburgh has the three main ingredients required for any successful startup: low cost of living, talent  pouring out of the higher education systems and a work ethic that is unlike any other city. We moved  ERIN from NYC to Pittsburgh in 2019, a change that allowed us to establish and scale our company  in a way that couldn't have been done anywhere else."   Mike Stafiej   CEO ERIN     "With our established industries, growing tech footprint and strong academic ecosystem, Pittsburgh is  well positioned to rival m ajor tech and innovation hubs, and we’ll continue to tap into the rich talent  pool to show folks that we’re more than just Steel City."   Joe Cardosi   Founder and Chief Executive Officer   Free Market Health     "Bloomfield leveraged years of research and developm ent at Carnegie Mellon University to start a  Pittsburgh technology company that now has customers and investors across the globe. CMU’s world - leading reputation in artificial intelligence and robotics was a key factor to Bloomfield’s success in  completing a Series A financing in 2022.”   Bob Delach   Bloomfield Robotis CFO     The City continues to see success with the Pittsburgh Promise program, which provides scholarships of  up to $5,000 per year for qualified students for four years to approved and accredited c olleges, universities,  or trade and technical schools in Pennsylvania. By the end of 2022, Pittsburgh Promise had administered  its 15th class of high school graduates, thus totaling more than 11,289 graduates of the Pittsburgh Public  Schools who were funde d by the Pittsburgh Promise program. Over $168.1 million in scholarships had  been given to facilitate attendance at 146 post -secondary schools. This investment in education  strengthens the City’s regional workforce as well, with alumni of the program havin g added value by their  employment at over 650 local companies.     The overall outlook for the City remains stable. The City was well -prepared for the COVID -19-induced  economic downturn, and we anticipate continued growth. This rebound would not have been pos sible  without the direct support from the federal government via the ARPA.  The investment in the City’s  recovery is considerable, and we are thankful to have been able to fully offset our financial losses over  the last two years. While much will be said i n the years to come about the impact of the virus, the efforts  to mitigate the fiscal downturn have been notable.     REVENUES     Real Estate Tax: Real estate property in the City is assessed by the Allegheny County Board of Property  Assessment, Appeals, and Review at a rate of 100% of its fair market value.

AWARDS      The GFOA awar ded a Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting to the City for its  ACFR for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. The Certificate of Achievement is a prestigious  national award recognizing conformance with the highest standards f or preparation of state and local  government financial reports.     In order to be awarded a Certificate of Achievement, a government unit must publish an easily readable  and efficiently organized ACFR that conforms to program standards. Such an ACFR must sat isfy both  generally accepted accounting principles and applicable legal requirements.     A Certificate of Achievement is valid for a period of one year only. The City has received a Certificate of  Achievement for the last thirty consecutive years (fiscal yea rs ended 1992 – 2021). We believe that our       414 G RANT  STREET  | CITY-COUNTY  BUILDING , FIRST  FLOOR  | 412 255 2054     current ACFR continues to conform to the Certificate of Achievement program requirements, and we are  submitting it to the GFOA to determine its eligibility for another certificate.     ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS     The preparation of this report could not be possible without the concerted effort of the entire staff of the  Controller's Office. The continued efforts of the Accounting Department are gratefully appreciated. I  would like to thank the employees of the various departments and Authorities of the City for their  assistance in providing the Controller's staff and the independent auditors with the necessary information  to complete this report.

Ricky Burgess, District 9 FINANCIAL SECTION i Independent Auditor’s Report The Honorable Members of Council City of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements Opinion s We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the governmental activities, the  aggregate discretely presented component units, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund  information of the City of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (City), as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, and the relate d notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the City’s basic  financial statements as listed in the table of contents. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the  respective financial position of the governmental activities, the aggregate discretely presented  component units, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of the City,as of  December 31,2022, and the respective changes in financial position and, the respective budgetary  comparison for the General Fund and Community Development Fund for the year then ended in  accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion s We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United  States of America (GAAS) . Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the  Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are  required to be independent of the City and to meet our other ethical responsibiliti es in accordance  with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we  have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion s. Change in Accounting Principle As described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the City adopted Governmental Accounting   Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 87, “Leases,” which requires the recognition of certain  lease assets and liabilities for leases that previously were classified as operating leases and  recognized as inflows of resources or outflows of resources based on payment provisions of the  contract.  Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter. The Honorable Members of Council City of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Independent Auditor’s Report iiResponsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements Management is responsi ble for the preparation and fair presentation ofthefinancial statements in  accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for  the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair  presentation offinancial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud  or error. In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are  conditions or events, consi dered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the City's ability  to continue as a going concern for twelve months beyond the financial statement date, including any  currently known information that may raise substantial doubt shortly thereafte r. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether thefinancial statements as a whole  are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report  that includes our opinion s. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute  assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally  accepted auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not  detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as  fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of  internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that,  individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based  on the financial statements. In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS , we: Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of thefinancial statements, whether  due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks.  Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and  disclosures in the financial statements. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit  procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing  an opinion on the effectiveness of theCity's internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is  expressed. Evaluate the appropriateness ofaccounting policies used and the reasonableness of  significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall   presentation of the financial statements. The Honorable Members of Council City of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Independent Auditor’s Report iiiConclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the  aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about theCity's ability to continue as a going concern  for a reasonable period of time. We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other  matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal  control related matters that we identified during the audit. Required Supplementary Information Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the required  supplementa ryinformation listed in the table of contents be presented tosupplement the basic  financial statements. Such information is the responsibility o f management and, although not a part  of the basic financial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board, who  considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in  an appropriat e operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited  procedures to the required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards  generally accepted in the United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of management  about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the information for consistency with  management’s responses to our inquiries, thebasic financial statements, and other knowledge we  obtained during our audit of the basic financial sta tements. We do not express an opinion or provide  any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient  evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance. Supplementary Information Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinion son the financial statements that  collectively comprise the City’s basic financial statements . The supplementary information listed in  the table of contents is presented for purposes of additional analysis and i s not a required part of the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived  from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare thebasic financial statements. The infor mation has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the  audit of thebasic financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and  reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare  the basic financial statements or to the basic financial statements themselves, and other additional  procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America.  In our opinion, the supplementary information is fairly stated ,in all material respects ,in relation to  the basic financial statements as a whole. The Honorable Members of Council City of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Independent Auditor’s Report ivOther Information Management is responsible for the introductory section, statisti cal section and other section  (collectively “other information ”)listed in the table of contents . The other information listed in the  table of contents does not include the basic financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.  Our opinions on the basic financial statements do not cover the otherinformation, and we do not  express an opinion or any form of assurance thereon. In connection with our audit of the basic financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other  information and consider whether a material inconsistency exists between the other information and  the basic financial statements, or the other information otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work performed, we conclude that an uncorrected material misstatement of the  othe r information exists, we are required to describe it in our report. Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania April 28, 202 3 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS vManagement’s Discussion and Analysis As management of the City of Pittsburgh (City), we offer the readers of the City’s financial  statements this narrative overview and analysis of the financial activities of the City for the fiscal  year ended December 31, 2022. We encourage readers to consider the information presented here  in conjunction with additional information that we have furnished in our letter of transmittal, which  can be found a t the beginning of this report. Financial Highlights Government -wide unrestricted net position showed a deficit of $1.38billion in 2022.The  accumulated deficit results principally from the City’s Net Pension Liability of $924.3 million,  Other Poste mployment benefits liabilit iesof $352.7 million , outstanding general obligation bonds  being issued over the years to finance projects that do not result in recording assets; specifically , to fund the payments to the Pension Trust Fund ($54.0 million outstanding as of December 31, 2022), the City’s borrowings to finance economic development efforts (including projects to the  City’s Authorities, pr incipally the URA), and maintenance expenditures on C ity infrastructure and  equipment needs. The deficiency will have to be funded from resources generated in future years. As of the close of the 2022fiscal year, the City’s governmental funds reported combined  ending fund balances of $414.2 million , an increase of $91.3 million from the previous year.  Approximately 40.4%of this total amount or $167.2 million is available for spending at the  government’s discretion (unassigned fund balance). At the end of the2022fiscal year, unassigned fund balance for the General Fund was $167.2 million (compared to $106.8 million in2021) or 27.4% of total General Fund expenditures and  debt service transfers for 2022, upfrom 18.4% in 20 21. The City’s outstanding general obligation bonds and notes including unamortized  premium/discount amounted to $488.0 million at the end of the fiscal year upfrom $472.7 million in 2021. Overview of the Financial Statements This Management’s Discussion and Analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the City’s  basic financial statements. The financial section of this report consists of three parts: Management’s Discussion and Analysis,  the basic financial statements (including notes to the financial statements and detailed budgetary  comparison schedules), and combining and individual fund statements.  The basic financial  statements present two diffe rent views of the City through the use of government -wide statements  and fund financial statements: The first two statements (pages 1 through 3) are government -wide financial statements that provide  short -term and long -term information about the City’s overall financial status. viThe remaining statements (pages 4 through 20) are fund financial statements that focus on  individual parts of City government and report operations in more detail than the government -wide  financial statements.   The governmental funds statements describe how general government services were financed such  as public safety and sanitation. Fiduciary fund statements provide information about pension, other post-employment benefit  plans, private -purpose trust funds, and custodial funds for which the City acts solely as a trustee  or agent for the benefit of others.  Fiduciary funds are not reflected in the government -wide  financial statements because the resources cannot be used to support City activities.  The financial statements include notes which provide an explanation for certain financial statement  line items and also provide more details for this information.  The statements are followed by a  section of required supplementary information that further explains and supports the information  in the financial statements.  In addition to these required elements, a section with combining  statements provides details about the non-major governmental funds that are presented in single  columns in the basic financial statements.  The following diagram, labeled A-1, shows how the  required components of this comprehensive annual financial report are arranged and relate to one  another.   Figure A -1 REQUIRED COMPONENTS OF THE ANNUAL COMPREHENSIVE FINANCIAL REPORT Summary                                              Detail Figure A-2 summarizes the major features of the City’s financial statements.  The remainder of  this overview section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis explains the structure and  contents of each of the st atements.Fund  Financial StatementsGovernment -wide Financial  StatementsManagement’s Discussion and  AnalysisBasic  Financial Statements Notes to  Financial StatementsRequired Supplementary Information viiFigure A -2 Major Features of City’s Government -Wide and Fund Financial Statements Fund Statements Government -wide  Statements Governmental Funds Fiduciary Funds Scope Entire City government  (except fiduciary funds) The activities of the City that  are not proprietary or  fiduciary, such as police, fire,  and recreationInstances in which the City is  the trustee or agent for  someone else’s resources, such  as the retirement plansfor City  employees Required financial statements •Statement of net position •Statement of activities•Balance sheet •Statement of revenues,  expenditures, and  changes in fund balance• Statement of fiduciary net  position •Combined statement of changes in fiduciary net  position Accounting basis and  measurement focusAccrual accounting and  economic resources focusModified accrual accounting  and current financial resources  focusAccrual accounting and  economic resources focus Type of asset/liability  informationAll assets and liabilities, both  financial and capital, and  short -term and long -termOnly assets expe cted to be  used up and liabilities that  come due during the year or  soon thereafter; no capital  assets includedAll assets and liabilities, both  short -term and long -term; the  City’s funds do not currently  contain capital assets, although  they can Type of inflow/outflow  informationAll revenues and expenses  during year, regardless of  when cash is received or paid Deferred inflows and Outflows recognizedRevenues for which cash is  received during or soon after  the end of the year;  expenditures when goods or  services have been received  and payment is due during the  year or soon thereafter Deferred inflows recognizedAll revenues and expenses  during the yea r, regardless of  when cash is received or paid Government -wide Financial Statements The government -wide financial statements are designed to provide readers with a broad overview  of the City’s finances in a manner similar to a private -sector business. The government -wide  financial statements include not only the City itself (known as the primary government), but also  legally separate Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority,  Public Parking Authority, and the Stadium Authority. Financial informat ion for these component  units reported separately from the financial information are presente d for the primary government  itself. Thegovernment -wide statements can be found in the financial section of this report. Although there are a number of government -wide financial statements, for the purposes of this  report, only two will be highlighted since they are closely related: the statement of net position and  the statement of activities. The statement of net position includes all of the City’s assets, liabilities, deferred inflows, and  outflows, except fiduciary funds.  Net position -the difference between the City’s assets and  deferred outflows of resources and liabilities and deferred inflows of resources -is one way to  measure the City’s financial health, or position.  Over time, increases or decreases in the City’s  net position serve as a useful indicator of whether thefinancial position of the City is improving  or deteriorating.   viii       Measurement Focus: Economic Resources Accounting Basis: AccrualThe statement of activities presents information showing how the government’s net position  changed during the most recent fiscal year.  All changes in net position are reported as soon as the  underlying event gives rise to the change that occurs, regardless of the timing of related cash flows.   Thus, revenues and expenses are reporte d in this statement for some items that will only result in  cash flows in future fiscal periods (e.g., uncollected taxes and earned but unused vacation leave).   Additional non-financial factors such as changes in the City’s real property tax base and gener al  economic conditions must be considered to assess the overall position of the City.   The primary features of government-wide financial statements are reflected in Figure A-3. Figure A -3 Government -wide Financial Statements •Governmental activities - Most of the City’s basic services are included here, such as the  police, public works, recreation , and general administration. Property and earned income  taxes, charges for services, and state grants finance most of these activities. Fund Financial Statements The fund financial statements provide more detailed information about the City’s most significant  funds, not the City as a whole. A fund is a group of related accounts that are used to maintain  control over resources that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives.     Funds are  used to keep track of specific sources of funding and spending for particular purposes.  The City,  like other state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance  with finance -relate d legal requirements. However, not all funds are the result of city policy; some  are required by state law.  The funds of the City can be divided into two categories, governmental  funds and fiduciary funds, and are explained in greater detail below:  •Governmental Funds -Most of the City’s basic services are included in governmental funds,  which focus on (1) how cash and other financial assets can readily be converted to cash flow  in and out and (2) the balances left at year-end that are available for spending.  Consequently,  the governmental funds statements provide a detailed short -term view that helps you  determine whether there are more or fewer financial resources that can be spent in the near  future to finance the City’s programs. Governmental funds are used to account for essentially  the same functions reported as governmental activities in the governm ent-wide financial  statements. The relationship between governmental activities (reported in the statement of Governmental Activities  Statement of Net Position            Assets + Deferred Outflows -  Liabilities –Deferred Inflows           = Net PositionStatement of Activities      Net Program (Expense) Revenue        + General Revenues      = Change in Net Position ixnet position and the statement of activities) and governmental funds is described in a  reconciliation that follows the governmental fund financial statements .  However, unlike the  government -wide financial statements, governmental fund financial statements focus on  near-term inflows and outflows of expendable resources, as well as on balances of  expendable resources available at the end of the fiscal year. Such information may be useful  in evaluating a government’s near -term financing requirements. Because the focus of government funds is narro wer than that of the government -wide  financial statements, it is useful to compare the information presented for governmental  funds with similar information presented for governmental activities. By doing so, readers  may better understand the long-term impact of the government’s near-term financing  decisions. Both the governmental fund balance sheet and the governmental fund statement  of reve nues, expenditures, and changes in fund balance provide a reconciliation to facilitate  this comparison between governmental funds and governmental activities.  The City maintains individual government alfunds. Information is presented separately in the  governmental fund balance sheet and in the governmental fund statement of revenues,  expenditur es, and changes in fund balance for the General Fund, the Capital Projects Fund ,  the Community Development Fund , the American Rescue Plan Act Fund, and the Debt  Service Fund, all of which are considered to be major funds. Data from the other six  governmental funds (non-major funds) are combined into a single, aggregated presentation  (other governmental funds). TheCity adopts an annual appropriated budget for its General Fund , Capital Projects Fund,  and Community Development Fund. A budgetary comparison statement has been provided  for these funds to demonstrate compliance with these budgets. The basic governmenta l fund financial statements can be found on pages 4-15of this report. Fiduciary Funds - (Pension Trust Funds , OPEB Trust Funds, Private- Purpose Trust  Funds and Custodial Funds ) –The Pension Trust Fund accounts for the operations of the  City’s pension plans for general municipal employees, police, and fire, covering  essentially all full-time employees.  The OPEB Trust Fund is used to report resources  held in trust for post-employme nt benefits other than pension benefits.  The City is  responsible for ensuring that the assets reported in fiduciary funds are used for their  intended purposes.  All of the City’s fiduciary activities are reported in a separate  statement of fiduciary net position and a statement of changes in fiduciary net position.

Government -wide Financial Analysis TheCity’sliabilities and deferred inflows of resources exceeded assets and deferred outflows of  resources by $ 1.20billion at the close of the most recent fiscal year. Net Pension and Other  Postemployment benefits liabilities totaled $1.27billion. By far the largest portion of the City’s  deficit in net position is its unrestricted deficit of $1.38billion . This deficit is partially offset by  investment in capital assets less any related debt still outstanding used to acquire those assets of  $153.4 million . The City uses these capital assets to provide services to citizens; consequently,  these assets are not available for future spending and the assets have been financed with debt in an  amount that exceeds the capital assets carrying value.  Although the City’s investment in capital assets is reported net of related debt, it should be noted  that the resources needed to repa y this debt must be provided fro m other sources, since the capital  assets themselves cannot be used to liquidate these liabilities. xiSummary of Condensed Net Position The following table presents a condensed summary of net position: City of Pittsburgh ’s Net Position At the end of the current fiscal year, the City reported a $1.2billion net deficit for the governmental  activities due in large part to GASB Statement Nos. 68and 75reporting requir ements of Net  Pension Liability and Other Postemployment Benefits as well as the City’s debt burden  outstanding .  2022 2021 Current assets 741 $             536 $           Non-current assets 8                   17               Capital assets 212                196             Total Assets 961                749             Deferred outflows related to pensi on 122                98               Deferred outflows related to OPEB 27                  22               Deferred chang e on refundi ng 8                   9                 Total Deferred Outfl ows of Resources 157                129             Current liabilities 384                272             Long -term liabilities, outstandi ng 1,835             1,761           Total Liabilities 2,219             2,033           Deferred inflows related to pensi ons 13                  84               Deferred inflows related to OPEB 92                  78               Total Deferred Inflows of Resources 105                162             Net investment in capital assets 153                164             Restri cted 22                  25               Unrestri cted (1,380)            (1,506)         Total Net Position (1,205) $         (1,317) $      Net Position($ millions)Governmental  Activities Assets Defer red Outflo ws of Reso urces Liabilities Defer red Inflows of Reso urces xii Governmental activities – Governmental activities increas ed the City’s net position by $1 12.3  million in 2022 as expenses were under revenues.

Such information is useful in  assessing the City’s financing requirements. In particular, unassigned fund balance ma y serve as  a useful measure of a government’s net resources available for spending at the end of the fiscal  year. The General Fund is the chief operating fund of the City, with revenues and expenses that are  connected to every aspect of the City. Revenues for the General Fund totaled $646.7 million in  2022, an increase of $78.4 million or by 14 .0% compared to 2021. Thepandemic and resulting  economic conditions continued to impact revenue to budget fluctuations, not as severely as 202 1.   The largest variances were the parking tax revenue which fell short of budget by $10.1 million as  many continued to work from home.  Also impacted negatively were rentals and charges with a negative variance of $8.6million . These losses were offset byan increase in payroll prep taxto $84million ,which was 19 million over budget , astronger than expected deed transfer tax of 65  million, 13 million over budget ,andhigher interest on investments resulting in interest revenue  4.4 million over budget. In addition to the above General Fund tax revenues, the City collected $19.2 million in the  Community Development Fund, $7.7 million in Capital Projects, and $5 2.0million in Non-major Governmental Funds ,mostly from pass-through of federal and state monies .  The City also  received $167million from the American Rescue Plan Act Fund of which $52.0million was  recognized as revenue for aiding recovery from the economic and health effects of the COVID- 19  pandemic .  The City created and adopted a four-year plan for utilizing the recovery funds in  accordance with all regulatory and statutory requirements.  This was the second of two allocations which was received in June 202 2. At the end of the current fiscal year,the City’s governmental funds reported combined ending fund  balances of $ 414.2 million, anincrease of $91.3 million from 2021. Approximately 40.4% of this  total fund balance, or $167.3 million ,constitutes unassigned fund balance, which is available for  spending at the government’s discretion. The remainder of the fund balance that is restricted for  endowments, employee benefits, State and Federal Purpose G rants, and capital projects is$102.8 million, the amount comm itted to interfund advance and specific programs is $40.0 million and  the amount assigned for encumbrances and debt service is $ 104.2 million .  At the end of the current fiscal year, the unassigned fund balance of the General Fund was $167.3 million, while total fund balance for the General Fund was $202.9 million.  As a measure of the  General Fund’s liquidity, it may be useful to compare both unassigned fund balance and total fund  balance to total fund expenditures. Unassigned fund balance represents 26.6%of total General  Fund expen ditures and operating transfers. The fund balance of the City’s General Fund increased by $73.0 million during the 2022fiscal  year compared to a increase of $24.5 million in 2021.This is primaril y due to increase s inpayroll  prep and earned income taxes and a transfer of $ 48.0 million from the American Rescue Plan Act  Fund . xvExpenditures and other uses, including d ebt service payments/transfers from the General Fund in  2022increased to $627.8 million, compared to $581.6 million in 2021representing aincrease of 7.9% or $ 46.2 million overall.  Transfers to the Debt Service Fund of $59.6 million ,combined with debt subsidies of $3.2million , totaled $62.8 million ,compared to $ 59.5 million in 2021.  The debt subsidies are for the URA are  commitments made by the City over the life of theirbonds. Debt service and debt subsidies  accounted for 8.3% of the total governmental expenditures ,illustrating the magnitude of the City’s  annual debt service . The Debt Service Fund has a total fund balance of $ 3.0million , all of which  is assigned for the payment of debt service.   The Community Development Fund had intergovernmental revenues of $19.2million and  expenditures of $ 19.2 million.  The Capital Projects Fund had $7.7 million of revenues , and $66.4 million in maintenance and non-capital related expenses , $60million in new capital debt proceeds  and $10.8 million in net operating transfe rs.  The Capital Projects Fund sfund balance increased  by $12.6 million to $151.9 in 2022as compared to $139.3 million as of December 31, 20 21due  to the issuance of a new bond and an increase in transfers from other funds.

Significant Events xviiEarly in 2018, a resolution by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania was adopted to allow theCity to  formally exit Act 47 oversight, thereby ending its designation as a “financially distressed  municipality.” During 2022,the City continued efforts to control costs, maximize collections with the  pandemic , and maintain solvency.  The cash balance available for general operations of the City as of  December 31, 20 22was $171.7 million; this was enough to maintain normal funct ion throughout the  City in January 2023.As of December 31, 20 22, the City had a General Fund un assigned fund balance  of $167.3 million. The City will continue to focus on strategies to fund long-term obligations,  principally net pension obligations, net other post-employment obligations, general obligation debt and  reduce its net deficit of $1.2billion in December 31, 2022. The City recognizes that the budgetary  impact of the COVID -19 pandemic continues tobe significant but remains optimistic that steps can be  taken to manage city finances going forward , including receipt of significant federal funding . Pension Funding Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Act 47 of 2009 required the City’s aggregate pension funding  level to be at least 50 percent by December 31, 2010 to avoid having the City’s pension funds  seized and administered by the Pennsylvania Municipal Retirement System.  TheCity met this  requirement by transferring $45 million to the Comprehensive Trust Fund (Fund )in 2010 and  agreeing to dedicate parking tax revenues for the next 31 years per Council legislation .  During  2021, Council legislation extended parking taxpayments dedicated to pension funding to 2046.    The City contributed $13.4 million of the parking tax revenue to the Fund from 2011 -2017 and  contributed $26.8 million from 2018 through 2022.  The City will continue to contribute $26.8  million per year from 2023through 2046.For 2022, the City contributed $103.5million , $50.3 million more than its actuarially determined contribution of $53.3 million . Cash Position During 2022, the City continued efforts to stabilize and improve the City’s financial condition,  and continued adaptions to pandemic conditions.   At the onset of 2023, the City expected cash flows to be sufficient to maintain a positive cash  position.

This isthe amount bywhich capital outlays and net deletions exceeded depreciation/amortization in the current period: Some levied taxes and other revenues willnotbecollected forseveral months after the City's year-end, they are not considered as"available" revenues inthe governmental funds.  Deferred inflows changed by this amount during the year. Changes inthe net OPEB liabilities and related deferred inflows and outflows of resources donotaffect current financial resources and, therefore, arenot reflected on the fund statements. The issuance oflong-term obligations (e.g., notes, bonds and leases) provides current financial resources togovernmental funds, while therepayment oftheprincipal oflong- term obligations consumes the current financial resources ofgovernmental funds. Neither transaction, however, has any effect onthe statement ofactivities. Also, governmental funds report theeffect ofpremiums, discounts, interest, and similar items when debt isfirst issued, whereas these amounts are deferred and amortized inthe statement ofactivities. This amount isthe net effect ofthese differences inthe treatment of long-term obligations and related items. Inthestatement ofactivities, certain expenses -workers' compensation, compensated absences, and claims and judgments aremeasured bytheamounts incurred during the year. Inthegovernmental funds, however, expenditures forthese items aremeasured bythe amount offinancial resources used. This amount represents the difference between the amount incurred versus the amount used.Changes inthe net pension liability and related deferred inflows and outflows of resources donotaffect current financial resources and, therefore, arenot reflected on the fund statements.Long-term receivables, including loan receivable due from component unit, arenotdue inthecurrent period and, therefore, arenotreported asreceivable inthefunds. Long- term receivables changed by this amount during the year.Amounts reported forgovernmental activities inthe statement ofactivities aredifferent because:CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA RECONCILIATION OF THE STATEMENT OF REVENUES, EXPENDITURES, AND CHANGES IN FUND BALANCE OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS TO THE STATEMENT OF ACTIVITIES See accompanying notes to financial statements. 8  Variance with Original Final Actual Final Budget Taxes, net of refunds and banking fees: Real estate 151,120$     151,120$     152,974$     1,854 $          Non-profit payment for services 445                445                409                (36)                  Payroll preparation 65,799          65,799          84,725          18,926           Amusement 16,985          16,985          16,846          (139)               Earned income 116,849       116,849       123,884       7,035             Deed transfer 51,990          51,990          65,383          13,393           Parking 56,933          56,933          46,876          (10,057)          Local Services Tax 14,641          14,641          15,483          842                 Institution and service privilege 604                604                433                (171)               Facility usage fee 4,249            4,249            3,673            (576)               Public service 1,049            1,049            1,106            57                   Penalties and interest 1,046            1,046            809                (237)               Act 77 -

The City operates  under a strong mayor form of government and provides the following services as authorized  by its charter: public safety (police, fire, and emergency medical services), highways and  streets, sanitation, economic development, cultural and recreational, public improvements,  planning and zoning, and general administrative services. The major accounting principles and practices followed by the City are presented below to  assist the reader in evaluating the financial statements and the ac companying notes. (A)The Financial Reporting Entity The criteria used by the City to evaluate the possible inclusion of related entities  (Authorities, Boards, Councils, etc.) outside of the legal City entity within its reporting entity  are financial account ability and the nature and significance of the relationship.  In  determining financial accountability in a given case, the City reviews the applicability of the  following criteria: The City is financially accountable for: 1.Legally separate organization s if City officials appoint a voting majority of the  organization’s governing body and the City is able to impose its will on the organization or if  there is a potential for the organization to provide specific financial benefits to, or impose  specific fin ancial burdens on, the primary government. a.Impose itsWill –If the City can significantly influence the programs, projects, or  activities of, or the level of services performed or provided by, the organization. b.Financial Benefit or Burden –Exists if the City (1) is entitled tothe organization’s  resources ,(2) is legally obligated or has otherwise assumed the obligation to finance the  deficits of, or provide support to, the organization, or (3) is obligated in some manner  for the debt of the organizatio n. CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSY LVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMB ER 31, 2 022 222.Legally separate organizations that are fiscally dependent on the City and a financial  benefit or burden relationship are present.  Fiscal dependency is established if the  organization is unable to adopt its budget, levy taxes or set rates or charges or issue bonde d  debt without approval by the C ity. Based on the foregoing criteria, the reporting entity has been defined to include all the  legally separate -government entities for which the City is financially accountable or for  which there is a signif icant relationship (component units).  Specific information on the  nature of the various potential component units and a description of how the  aforementioned criteria have been considered in determining whether or not to include or  exclude such organizati ons in the City’s financial statements are provided in the following  paragraphs.  Audited financial statements for all of the component units are available for  public inspection in the City Controller’s office. (B)Net Position Deficit and Liquidity As of December 31, 2022, the City had a general fund unassigned fund balance of $167.3 million and a general fund cash balance of $171.4 million. The City will continue to focus on  strategies to fund long -term obligations, principally net pension obligations, net other post - employment obligations, general obligation debt and reduce its net position deficit of $1.21 billion at December 31, 2022. (C)Individual Component Unit Disclosures Blended Component Units Some component units, despite being legally separate from the City government, are so  inter twined with the City government, whethe r through sharing common governing boards  with the City or through providing services solely to the City that they are, in substance, the  same as the City government and are reported aspart of the City government.  The blended  component units reported in this way are the following : City of Pittsburgh Equipment Leasing Authority City Pension Trust City of Pittsburgh Equipment Leasing Authority (ELA) The ELA was incorporated in 1980 toserve as a financing vehicle for the acquisition of  equipment.

(D)Financial Statement Presentation Government– Wide Financial Statements – Financial statements prepared using the  economic resources measurement focus and full accrual basis of accounting forall the  government’s activities are required.  These statements include all assets, deferred outflows  of resources, liabilities, deferred inflows of resources, revenues, and expenses ofthe  primary g overnment and its component units, exc luding fiduciary a ctivities. The effect of City inter -fund activity has been eliminated from these statements.  The City  does not allocate indirect expense s.  The government -wide statemen ts segregate  governmental activities, which are normally supported by taxes and interg overnmental  revenues, and business- type activities, if any, which rely on user fees and charges for  support.  Component units, which are legally separate and discretely pr esented , are also  segregated. Stateme ntof Net Position –presents both governmental and business -type activities, if  any, on the full accrual, economic resource basis, which incorporates long-term assets and  recei vables; deferred outflows of resources ; long-term debt and obligations ; and deferred  inflo ws of resources . Statement of Activ ities–presents the net cost of each individual function.  Program  revenues are presented as a reduction of the total cost of providing program services.

Taxes and other revenue  sources not reported as program revenue are inclu ded as g eneral revenue. Fund Financial Statements –The City’s accoun ts are organized on the basis of funds , each  of which isconsidered to be a separate accounting entity.  The operation of each fund is  accounted for by providing a separate set of self-balancing accounts that comprise its  asse ts, liabili ties, deferred inflows of reso urces, fund balances or net position , revenue s, and expenditures or expenses, as appropriate. Government resources are allocated to and accounted for in individual funds base d upon  thepurposes for which they are tobe spent and t he means by which spend ing activit ies are  controlled .  The various fundsare grouped in the basic financial statements in this report  into two broad fund categories as follows: CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSY LVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMB ER 31, 2 022 30Governmental Funds acco unt for expendable financial resources. Governmental fu nd types  use the flow of current financial resources measurement focus . The major governmental  funds are: General Fund –The General Fund is the general operating fund of the City.  It finances the  regular day-to-day operations of the Cit y.  It is used t o account for all finan cial revenu es and  expenditure s, except those re quired to be accounted for in another fund. Debt Service Fund –The Debt Service Fund is used to account for the accumulation of  resource s for, and the payment of, long -term debt principal, interest, and rela ted costs. Special Revenue Community Developme ntBlock Grant Fund –Community Development  Block Grant Fund is used to account for the cost of neighborhood development and  impro vement projects.  These programs are financed primarily by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Developm ent (HUD) under the Community Development Block Grant  (CDBG) program.  A substantive portion of the funds received under the program have been  alloc ated to the Urban Redevelopment Authorit yof Pittsburgh. Capital Projects Fund –A Capita l Projects Fund isused to account forfinancial resources to  be used for the acquisition or construction of major capital facilities. Special Revenue American Rescue Plan ActFund – American Rescue Plan Act F und is used  to account forfinancia l resources to be used for expenditure s allowable under the  American Rescue Plan Act.

Fiducia ryFunds account for assets held by the City in a trustee capacity or as an agent for  individuals and other governmental units.  The fiduciary funds are: Pension Trust Fund –The Comprehensive Fund accounts for the operations of the City’s  pension plan s as described in Note 7.  This isaccounted for in the same mann er as a  proprietary fund type.  Measur ement focus is upon determination of the change in net  position and financial position. OPEB Trust Fund - Used to report resources held in trust for post -employment benefits  other than pe nsion benefit for both the OPEB retiree plan and d isabled firefighte rs plan.    CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSY LVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMB ER 31, 2 022 31Private -Purpose Trust Fund -Accounts for assets held in trust for healthcare and worker’s  compensation benefits. Custodial Funds –Accounts fo r assets held for, and due to other gove rnment s or indiv iduals  for whom it was collected .

The basic financial statements also include the statement of net position and statement of  activities of the following co mponent un its: Pittsburgh Water and SewerAuthority Stadium Authority of the City of Pittsburgh PublicParking Authority of Pittsburgh Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh Budgetary Comparison Statements –The statements are prese nted to demonstra te  whether resources were obtaine d andused in accordance with the gove rnment’ s legally  adopted budg et for the General Fund and the Community Development Fund.  The City  revises the original budget over the course of the year forvarious reasons.  Under the  current reporting model, budget aryinformation continues to be provid ed and includes a  comparison of the government’s original adopted budget to the current comparison of final  budget and actual results.   The City’s budg et is prepared ona non-GAAP basis as describ ed  in Note 2.   (E)Basis ofAccount ing Basis of accounting refers tothe point at which revenues and expenditures or expenses are  recognized in the accounts and reported in the financial statements.  Basis of accounting  relates to the timing of the measure ments made, regardless of the measurement focus  applied. Government al activities in the government -wide statement are presented using the  economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting, as are the  fiduc iary fund financi al stateme nts.  Revenues are reco gnized when earned, and expenses  are recogniz ed when a liability has been incurred, regardless of the timing of related cash  flows. CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSY LVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMB ER 31, 2 022 32Governmental funds are accounted for using the current resource measureme nt focus and  the modified accrual basis of account ing. Revenues are recogniz ed when they become  measurable and avail able.  General Fund tax revenues are considered measurable when  they have been levied.  To be considered available and thus susceptible to accrual, the real estate taxes must be collected withintheCity’s period of availabilit y of sixty (60) days.  The  portion of uncollected real estate taxes that are deemed to be collectible at the end of this  period are reported as deferre d inflows of reso urces . Interest income and intergovernmental rece ivables(state and federal grants to the exte nt of allowable  expend itures) are considered susceptible to accrual.  The City considers all non-real estate  taxes and other revenues reported in the governmental fund to be available if the revenue s  are collect ed withinsixty (60) days. Expenditur es are generally recognized u nder the  modified accrual basis of accounting when the related fund liability is incurred .  However,  debt service expendit ures ,including lease payme nts, and other long -term liabiliti es, such as workers’ compensation, accrue d claim s and judgme nts, and both short - and long -term  compensated absences are recorded only when payment is due and payable.   General  capital asset acquisitions, includin g entering into cont racts giving the City the right to use  leased assets, are reported as expenditures in governmenta l funds.  Issuance of long -term  debt and financing through leases are reported as other financing sources. The City generally uses restric ted assets first for ex penses incurre d for which both res tricted  andunrestricted assets are available.  The City may defer theuse of restricted assets based  on a review of the specific situation. Non-exchange transactions, in which the City receives value without directly giv ing value in  return, includ e real estate and other taxes, grants, entitleme nts, and donations.  On an  accrual basis , revenue from property taxes isrecognized in the fiscal year for which the  taxes are levied.  Revenue from grants, entitlements, and donati ons are recogn ized in the  fiscal year in which a ll eligibility require mentshave been satisfie d.  Eligibility requirements  include timing requirements, which specify the year when the resources are required to be  used or the year whe n use is first permitte d; matching re quirements, in which the City must provide local resourc estobe used for specif ied purpos e; and expenditure requirements, in  which the resources are provided to the City on a reimbursement basis.  On a modified  accrual basis, revenue from non-exchange transactions mus t be available beforeit can be  recognized. (F)Cash and C ash Equivale nts Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments, including trust and  restricted assets, with an original maturity of three months or less.  Note 3, Deposit s and  CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSY LVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMB ER 31, 2 022 33Investments, provides a detailed disclosure regard ing cash, cash equivalen ts,and  investments held by the City. (G)Investments Investments in all funds are carried at fair value or amortized cost, as applicable .   Investments consist of avariety of investments including direct obligations of the U.S.  governm ent, mon ey market funds, corpora te and other obligations, guaranteed  investments, money market trust funds, and repurchase agreements.  Note 3, Deposits and  Inve stments, provides a detailed disclo sure regarding cash, cash equi valents,and  investments . TheCity categorizes its fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy established  by generally accepted accounting principles.  The hierarchy is based onthe valuation inputs  used to measu re the fair value of the asset . Level 1 inputs are quoted prices inactive  mark ets for iden tical assets; Level 2 inputs are significant other observable inputs; Level 3  inputs are significant unobservable inputs. (H)Due To/From Other Governments Outstandin g balances betw een the City an dother governments are repo rted as du e to/from  other governme nts. (I)Taxpayer Assessed Taxes Receivable Local wage taxes , payroll preparation tax, parking tax and other miscellaneous City ta xes are  recorded in theCity’s acco unts as taxpaye r asses sed rece ivables and revenue at the timeof  theunderlying transactions .In the governmental fund statements, taxes for which there is  an enforceable legal claim as of December 31, 2022 which were levied tofinance fiscal year  2022 operations have been recor ded as defer red inflows of resourc esuntil such time as the   taxes beco meavailab leon a modi fied accrual basis.Local wage taxes are collected by a  third part y in accordance with PA Act 32.    (J)Other Receivables Other City accounts receivable , primarily charges for services, are recorded in the City’s accounts as other rec eivables whe n earned , less an allowa ncefor uncollectible accounts. CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSY LVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMB ER 31, 2 022 34(K)Capital Assets and Leases Capital Assets Capital assets acquired or constructed by the City are reported in the government -wide  financial statements. Capi tal assets are record edat historical cost or estima ted historical  cost (except for the intangible right -to-use lease dassets, the measurement of which is  discussed under Leases below).   Capital assets are those assets with an initial individu al cost  of more than $5,000 and estimated useful life in exce ss of one year.  Gifts or contr ibutions  are recorded at acquisition value when received .  Depreciation isreco rded on a straight -line  basis over the estimated useful life of each capital asset.  No depreciation expense is  recorded for land and construction- in-progress.  The value of the City’s art collection is  indeterminable and would not be material to capital assets as a whole.  The estimate d  useful lives for capital assets are asfollows: Furniture and fi xtures   3-5 years Building and structur es 25-50 years Equipment   2-10 years Infrastructure 20-50 years Vehicles   2-1 0 years Right -to-use leased asse ts 3-7years Leases The City is a lessee for noncancellable lease sofproperty and equipment.  The City recogn izes a lease liability and an intangible right -to-use lease asset (lease asset) in the  government -wide financial statemen tsfor each of these leases .  The City recognize s lease  liabilities with an initial individual v alue of $100,000 or more. At the commencement of a lease, theCity initially measures thelease liability at the present  value of paymen ts expected to bemade during the lease term. Subsequently, the lease  liability is reduced by the principal portion of lease payments made. The lease asset is  initially measured as the initial amount of the lease liabi lity, adjusted for lease payments  made at or before the leasecommen cement date, plus certain initial direct costs.  Subsequently , the lease asset is amortize d on a straight -line basis over its useful life.  Keyestimates and judgments related to leases include how the City determi nes (1) the  discount rate it uses to discount the expected lease payments to present value, (2) lease  term, and (3) lease payments. CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSY LVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMB ER 31, 2 022 35The Cityuses theintere st rate charged bythe lessor as the discount rate. When  the interest rate charged by the lessor isnot provided, the City generally uses its estimated incremen tal borrowing rate as the discount rate for leases.  The lease term includes the noncancellable period of the lease. Lease payments  included in the measureme nt of the lease liability are comp osed of fixed  payments and purcha seoption price that the City isreasonably certain to exercise.  The City monitors changes in circum stan cesthat would require a remeasurement of its  lease and will remeasure the lease assetand liability if certain changes occur that are  expected to sig nificantl yaffect the amount of the lease liability.  Lease assets are reported with capital assets and lease liabilities are reported with long - term debt on thestatement of net position. (L)Deferred Outflow s/Inflow s of Resour ces In ad dition to assets, t hestateme ntof net position and/or the balance sheet will sometimes  report a separate section for deferred outflows of resources.  This separate finan cial  statement element, deferred outflo wsof resources, represent s a consump tionof net assets and/or fund balance tha t applies to a future period and so will not be recognized as an  outflow of resources (expense/expenditure) until then.  The City and component units have four items that qualif y for reporting in this ca tegory: The accumulated decrease in fai r value o fhedging derivatives. Adeferred charge on refunding results from the difference in the carrying value  of refunded debt and its reacquisit ion price.  This amount is deferre d and  amortized over the shorter of th e lifeof the refunded or refunding debt.   In conjunction with pens ion accounting requirements, the changes of  assumptions and net differences between projected and actual earnings on  pension investme nts arerecorded as a deferred outflow ofresources related to  pensions.  These amounts aredetermined based on the actua rial valuation performedfor the plan as described further in Note 7 .  In addition, the difference  between expected and actual experience related to the Muni cipal and Firemen  pension funds are recorded as a deferred outflow of resourc es related to  pensions. This amo unt is dete rmined based on the actuarial valuatio n  performed for the plan a s described further in Note 7. In conjunction with OPEB accounting requirements, changes of assumptions and  net difference between project ed and actual earnings on OPEB plan invest ments CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSY LVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMB ER 31, 2 022 36are recorded as a deferred outflow of resou rces related to OPEB.  These  amou nts are determined based on the actuarial valuati on performed for the  plan s as described further in Note 8.    In addition to liabil ities, thestatement of netposition and/or balance sheet will someti mes  report a separate section for deferred inflows of resources . Th isseparate financial  stateme nt elem ent, deferred inflo ws of resources , represents an acquisition of net  assets/ fund balance that applies to a future period(s) and so will not be recognized as an  inflow of resources (revenue ) until that time. The City hasone type of item, which arise s  under a modified accrual basis of accou nting that qualifies for reporting in this catego ry.  Accord ingly, the item, unavail able revenue, is reported only in the governme ntal funds  balance sheet. The governmental funds report unavailable reve nues from prop erty taxes,  payroll prepar ation taxes and other taxes . These amounts are deferred and reco gnized as  aninflow of resources in the period that the amounts become available .  Under the full  accrual basis, the City and component unitshave items that qualify for reporting in these categories : In conjunction with pension accounting requirements, thediffere nce between  expected andactual experience for the pension plan related to the Police and Firemen funds as a deferred inflow sof resources related to pensions.  These amount saredetermined based o n the actuaria l valuation per formed for the plan  as describ edfurth er in No te7. In c onjunction with OPEB accounting requirements, the difference between  expec ted and actual experience for the OPEB plan s, changes in assumpti ons, and  the net differ ence between projected and actual earnings on OPEB plan  investments are recorded asadeferredinflow of resources related to OPEB.   These amounts are determined based on the actuarial valuation performed for  the plan sas described f urther in No te 8. Deferred amounts re lated to l eases. (M) Workers’ Co mpensation and Other Risk Man agement The City isself-insured forpurposes of workers ’ compensation benefits.  Both short -and- long -term amounts payable are reported within the government -wide financ ial statements   only.    In order to qualify for and maint ain self-insur ance status, the City mus t comply with certai n Commo nwealth r equirements .  The requirements for 2023 are as follows: CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSY LVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMB ER 31, 2 022 37Maintain an irrevocable trust fund.

The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (Commonwealth) allocate s cer tain funds   to assist in pens ion funding.

The City’s plan to meet thislevelof funding includedtransferring approximatel y $45 million  to theCompreh ensive TrustFund which was in the Debt Service Reserve Fund in 2010 and  dedicat ing parking tax reve nues for the next 31 years per Council legislation .

The City will continue tocontribut e $26.8millio n peryear from 2022 through 2046.   While the present value of the dedicated future parking tax revenue s  for futurepensi on contri butions did not meet the criteria for recognit ion as an asset in the  City’s financial statements or those of theCompr ehensive Trust Fund,itwas treated as an  actuarial asset for purposes of fund ing levels under Commonwealth of Pennsylva niaAct 44  of 2009 and the City was determined to have met the required funding level to avoid  takeover of the City pens ions by the Penn sylvania Municipal Retirement System and the  parking revenue stream continues to be treated as an actuarial asset for fu nding pur poses .

If a counterpar ty failed toperform acco rdingto the terms of the interest rate swap agreeme nt, there  issome risk o f loss to the PWSA, up to the fai rvalue of theswaps.   The PWSA currently does not enter into master netting arrangements with its  counterpartie s.  As such, each derivative instrum entshould be evalu ated onan indiv idual  basis forcred it risk.  As of December 31, 2022, the Series2017 C recei ve variable, pay  variable derivative instrument current ly hasa negative fair value position to the Authorit y; ther efore,the Authority is notexposedto cr edit risk. However, t he Series 20 17 C receivable  variable, pay fixedderivative instruments were subject to credit risk, as they had a positive  fair value. Concentration of credit risk:  The PWSA’s outstan ding mark et value as of December 31,  2022 is $13,6 22,0 00withone coun terp arty and $6,161,000 with the second counterparty.   Both coun terparti esoperate in the same markets and could be similarl y impacted by  changes in economic or other condi tions. It is the PWS A’spolicy to requir e counterpartycollateral posting provision s in its non- exchange traded derivative instruments.  Their terms requir e collateral to be postedif the  respective counterp arty’s credit rating falls below BBB- by S&P Global Ratings and the swap insurer becomes bankr upt. The amou nt of collater alto be posted is calculated based on  derivatives in asset positio ns to thePWSA.   As of year- end, thecounterparties had notand  were not required to post collateral for these tran sactions. CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSY LVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMB ER 31, 2 022 118Termination risk is the risk that aderivative’s unsc hedu led endwill affectthe  PWSA’sasset/liability strategy or will present the PWSA with potentially significant unscheduled terminatio n paymen ts to the counterparty.  The counterparties to the  interest rate swap s do not have the abilitytovoluntarily termin ate theinterest rate  swap ; however, the PWSA is exposed to termination risk in the even t that one or  more ofthecounterparties defaults. The PWSA has the ability to voluntarily  terminate the swaps with prior written consent of the insurerbyprov iding between  2and 20 b usiness da ysnotice to the counte rparty.  The PWSA must d emonstr ate the  ability to pay all am ounts due to the counte rparty o n the termination date.    Interest rate risk is the risk th at chan gesin inter est rates will adversely af fect the fair  values of a governme nt’sfinancial instrume nts or cash flows.  The interes t rate  swapsarehighly sensi tiveto changes in interest rates; changes in the variable rate  will have a mat erial effect o n the swap’s fair v alue. Basis risk is the risk that arises when variab le inter est rates on a derivati veand an  associated bond or other interest-paying financial instrument are based on differ ent  indexes.  The PWSA is subject to basis risk on the overlay swap to the extent SIFMA  differs from70% of one-monthLIBOR or the federalfundsrate.  Although expe cted  to correlate, the relation ships between different index esvary and that varian ce  could adversely affect the PWSA ’s calculated payments , and as a resultcost savings  orsyntheti c interestrates m ay notbe real ized.   ThePWS A isfurther subject to basisrisk in the event that the underlyin g bonds become  fixed rateBank Bonds or that the mat urity of the underlying bonds is accelerated. Rollover risk is the riskthat a derivative associated with the PWSA’s debt does not  extend to the maturity of that de bt.  When the derivative termin ates, the associ ated  debt will nolonger have the benefit ofthe derivative.  The PWSA is not exposed to  rollover risk as theswap agreements terminat e onthe same day the last payme ntis  due ontherespective bonds. Contin gencies All of the PWSA ’s deriv ative instrument s include provisions that require the PWSA to post  collateral in the event that the credit ratings of its credit support prov ider’s senior long  term, unsecured debtcredit ratingfalls belowBBB- by S&P Globa lRatings and FSA, the  swap insurer, becomes bankrupt.  The collateral is to be post ed in the form of cash, U.S.  Treasuries or other approve d securities. As of year-end, th e PWSA was not require d to post colla teral for thes e transacti ons.

CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSY LVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMB ER 31, 2 022 131Component Units: Conse nt Order-PWSA The PWSA is subject to federal regulati on underthe Clean Wate rAct (197 7)and regula tions adopted unde r that Act.  Among the specific requiremen ts applicable to the PWSA ’s system  are those imposed bythe United States Environment al Protection Agenc y’s Comb ined  Sewer Overflow (CSO) Polic y (1994 ).  On January 29, 2004 ,the PWSA and theCity exec uted  a Consen t Order and Agreement (Order) regarding wet we ather sewer overflows within the City.  Theother signatori es to the Order are the Pen nsylvaniaDepa rtment o f Environmental  Prote ction (DEP ) and t he Allegheny County Hea lth Depart ment(ACH D).  Generally, the Orderrequires the PWSA and the City to asse ssthe City sewers to develop a  plan with ALCOSAN to address wet weath er sewer overf lows withintheCity.  The Order is  part of a sewer assess ment program for all municipal ities servedby ALCOSAN .  Todate,  assess men tactivitie s have been comple ted for all ac cessible critical sewers and separate  sanitarysewe rs with the exce ption of any additi onal se wers discovered through continued  rese arch and invest igation.  Critical sewe rs were defined inthe Order as: trunk sewersthat  are a final conve yance to the ALCOSAN Sewer System, sewers associat ed with areas of  chronic basement flooding, sewers asso ciated with areas of chronic main tenance, sewers  associated with c hronic surcharge, sewers downstream of diversio n structure s, sewers  whe re additional infor mation is necessary for model development, and sewers deemed a  priority for inspection by a professionalengineer. Ongoing pipe and manhol e repairs are  being completed toprovide CCTV access toremai ning inacces sible critica l/sanitary sewer  pipes.  Assessm ent activi tiesfor non-critical sewers are tobe comple ted on a longer  schedule.  The majority of accessible non-critical manholes have been inspected with  ongoing effortsto complet eany remai ning ornewly iden tified access iblenon-critical  manholes. The required Wet Weather Feasibility Study (WWFS) was submi tted to the DEP  and ACHD on time in July of 2013.   Thislong-term control plan outlined system-wide  impro vemen ts,including Green Infrastructure (GI) that PWSA would impleme nt over the  next 20 years.  As this Order with the DEP expired in March 2015, the U.S.Environmental Protection  Agency (USEPA) became the main regulatory body to which thePWSA isrespons ible.  On January 21, 2016, t he USEPA issued a Clean W ater Act Section 308 Information Request to  the PWS A. The USEPA 308 request require dthe PWSA to submit detailed information on  past Order performanceand activit ies.  It also require dthe PWSA to conduct a source  reduction analysis fortheentir e ser vice area, fo llowed by GI d emonstration proje cts. CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSY LVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMB ER 31, 2 022 132PWSA hired two engin eering firms to ass ess and mo del the se wer syst em, responding to the first phase oftheUSEPA 30 8 request by the due date March 31,2016.  Thesecond phase of the requ est wasresponded toby the submission of a source reduction studyby the due date of December 1, 2016 and t he submissio n of project performa nce evaluations f or  certain construction GI demonstration project sby thedue date of December 1, 2017.  A n  additio nal 308reque st fromthe USEPA was rece ived i n October 2016 seeking more detailed  information and further actions regard ingthe assessme nt of the PWSA ’s sewer system.The  respo nse to the October 2016 reque stfrom th e USEPA was deliveredin Januar y 2017. Inaddition to theassessment, theUSEPA 308 request alsorequires the PWSA a nd the City  tocontinue impleme nting the NineMinim um Contr ols to reduce combined sewe r  overflows, and to perform repairs and maint enance of defic iencies revealed by the assessmen t.  ThePWSA maint ainsan exped itedresponse to significant structural failures of  the sewer system where imminent structural failures are determined by a profession al engineer and prioritize dfor repair.  Ongoing sewer linereplacement, point repair, and  trench less rehabil itation projects have be en implemented to add ress struc tural deficiencies.    The USEPA 308 request also requires the submission of informatio n on anongoing, rolling  basis,updating the progress ofthe evalu ations and improvements , as well as water quality  impacts.   These reports are submitted monthly. The PWSA ha s begun nego tiations with EPA, the U.S. Department of Justi ce (DOJ), and DEP  over the terms of aconsent decree (CD) that will address the control of sanitary and  combin ed sewer overflowswith in theCity.  Such a decree willlikely set out anenforceab le framework for bringing the PWSA ’s sanitary and combined sewe r system s into complia nce  withapplicable require ments of the federal Clean Wate r Act and Pennsylvania Clean Streams Law . Given the broadscope of apotential CD, the size ofthe sewer system in the City, and the  various cond itions and/or deficiencies that may be discovered by the assessment, it is  difficult to predict thetotal cost of compli ance with the CD. Mor eover, it isdifficult to predict wha t, if any, largescale and/or regional capitalimprovements may be required after  the completion of the assessment to address wet weatherseweroverflows in the City and  in the ALCOSAN service area. Costsassociated withCD andCOA complia nce will be  reflec tedin the capital impr ovement program and funded by proceeds of potential future   bond issuances.

Additionally, separate actuarial valuations are performed  annually for each plan.  However, the individual plans do not record the undivided  interest in the investments in their individual plans since the assets of the  Comprehens ive Trust are available for the payment of benefits and expenses of any of  the three pension plans without limitations. Therefore, in accordance with  Governmental Accounting Standards, the City is considered to be administering a single  plan for financial reporting purposes.  The three pension plans plus the Comprehensive  Trust constitute the City's Pension Plan.
