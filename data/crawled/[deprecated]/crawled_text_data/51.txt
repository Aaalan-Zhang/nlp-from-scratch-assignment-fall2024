Theater
Four badass women lose their heads in this irreverent comedy set during the French Revolution’s Reign of Terror. Playwright Olympe de Gouges (Rhonny Dam), assassin Charlotte Corday (Sarah Baker), former queen Marie Antoinette (Jenn Rian), and Haitian rebel Marianne Angelle (Myriah Cross) try to beat back extremist insanity in this dream-tweaked comedy about violence and legacy, art and activism, feminism and terrorism, compatriots and chosen sisters, and how we actually go about changing the world. It’s a true story. Or total fiction. Or a play about a play. Or a raucous resurrection that ends in a song and a scaffold.

Theater
The Pittsburgh Savoyards continue their 87th season this fall with Gilbert and Sullivan’s aesthetic operetta, Patience. Patience satirizes the aesthetic movement of the 1870s and 1880s. Two rival poets, Reginald Bunthorne and Archibald Grosvenor, vie for the affection of the beautiful dairy maid Patience. The opera humorously critiques the pretensions of the art world and the fickleness of romantic ideals, ending with a series of romantic resolutions that leave the characters paired off happily.

Theater
Late one night, drunk-stumbling home through a neighborhood park, two siblings’ feet take root in the earth. Literally. Word of this extraordinary event spreads and brings together an otherwise disparate group of strangers, each seeking renewed purpose. The Trees by Agnes Borinsky asks us to consider: in our mercenary world, how can we have a more expansive notion of what change is possible? What of our old lives do we hold onto?
