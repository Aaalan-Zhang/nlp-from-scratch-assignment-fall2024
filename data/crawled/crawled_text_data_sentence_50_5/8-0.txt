[ 4 ] The region includes Allegheny County ,  Pittsburgh's urban core county and economic hub, and seven adjacent Pennsylvania counties: Armstrong , Beaver , Butler , Fayette , Lawrence , Washington , and Westmoreland in Western Pennsylvania, which constitutes the Pittsburgh, PA Metropolitan Statistical Area MSA as defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget . [ 5 ] As of the 2020 census , the Greater Pittsburgh region had a population of over 2.37 million people. Pittsburgh, the region's core city, has a population of 302,971, the second-largest in the state after Philadelphia . Over half of the region's population resides within Allegheny County, which has a population of 1.24 million and is the state's second-largest county after Philadelphia County .

[ 11 ] By this definition, the informal regional boundaries are similar to historical interpretations where the region is defined as the central portion of the Allegheny Plateau to the west and north of the Allegheny Front and south of Lake Erie and Pennsylvania's Northern Tier . [ 12 ] The hills and river valleys along the Upper Ohio River and its many eastern tributaries, including the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers have historically been the major centers of population of the region. [ 12 ] According to this research the US can be divided into 'mega regions' based on the most extreme commuting patterns within a geographical area (commutes within 100 miles from the core city). By this liberal definition, the Pittsburgh mega region consists of twenty-eight Pennsylvania counties ( Allegheny , Armstrong , Beaver , Bedford , Blair , Butler , Cambria , Cameron , Centre , Clarion , Clearfield , Crawford , Elk , Erie , Fayette , Forest , Greene , Huntingdon , Indiana , Jefferson , Lawrence , Mercer , Mifflin , Somerset , Venango , Warren , Washington , and Westmoreland ), nineteen West Virginia counties ( Barbour , Brooke , Doddridge , Grant , Hancock , Harrison , Lewis , Marion , Marshall , Mineral , Monongalia , Ohio , Preston , Randolph , Taylor , Tucker , Tyler , Upshur , and Wetzel ), five Ohio counties ( Belmont , Columbiana , Harrison , Jefferson , and Monroe ), and two Maryland counties ( Allegany and Garrett ), and portions of Chautauqua, New York in and around Ripley . [ 11 ] The combined population of the megaregion was over 4.9 million in 2016. [ 13 ] Border of Pittsburgh Megaregion showing included counties [ 14 ] There are also several formal definitions of Greater Pittsburgh which are often used in media mentions of the region. These include the Office of Management and Budget 's Pittsburgh, PA Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) and Pittsburgh-New Castle-Weirton, PA-OH-WV Combined Statistical Area (CSA). [ 15 ] The Nielsen Corporation 's Pittsburgh Designated Market Area (DMA) is another commonly used formal definition of the region. [ 16 ] There are nineteen counties included in at least one of these definitions and their combined population was over 2.9 million in 2016.

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] Pittsburgh's association with the Great Lakes region is due in part to its economic, demographic and commuter connections to Great Lakes cities like Cleveland , Erie , Toledo and even Detroit . [ 20 ] Christopher Briem, an economist at the University of Pittsburgh 's University Center for Social and Urban Research, has argued that southwestern Pennsylvania is "far more interconnected" with northeastern Ohio than it is with the eastern half of Pennsylvania, and that the industries of Pittsburgh are primarily linked to Ohioan cities such as Youngstown , Akron , and Cleveland , not to Pennsylvanian cities such as Allentown , Scranton , or Philadelphia . [ 21 ] He notes that, conversely, the population centers of northeastern Ohio are primarily connected with Pittsburgh and only secondarily connected to the state capital of Columbus . Briem argues that "In so many ways the state boundaries we think of as important are no more than lines on a map." [ 21 ] In recognizing their economic interdependence, Briem coined the term "Cleveburgh" to refer collectively to the cities of Cleveland and Pittsburgh, along with the smaller towns dotting the corridor of I-76 between the cities. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] Robert Lang and Arthur Nelson of the Metropolitan Institute at Virginia Tech also identify the region between Cleveland and Pittsburgh as being an interconnected "megapolitan area" and refer to it as the "Steel Corridor".

Several area colleges and universities serve the region. Pittsburgh itself is home to many colleges, universities, and research facilities, the most well-known of which are Carnegie Mellon University , the University of Pittsburgh , and Duquesne University .

Transportation [ edit ] Airports [ edit ] Pittsburgh International Airport 's Landside Terminal Pittsburgh International Airport ( IATA : PIT ) is located 17 mi (27 km) to the west of downtown Pittsburgh in Findlay . [ 25 ] The smaller but less crowded Arnold Palmer Regional Airport ( IATA : LBE ) to the east of downtown in Latrobe provides commercial service to the metro area. Pittsburgh International was the fortress hub of US Airways from 1952 to 2005 with over 500 daily departures to more than 110 destinations in 2000. By 2007, fewer than 70 departures to 21 destinations remained. [ 26 ] In 2007, US Airways did select the airport for its new $25 million, 27,000 sq ft (2,500 m 2 ), 600-employees-strong Global Flight Operations Center . Since being de-hubbed the airport has seen expanded service from JetBlue , Southwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines ' direct trans-Atlantic service to Paris. Arnold Palmer Regional Airport offers commercial service via Spirit Airlines to Florida and South Carolina. Palmer has had commercially scheduled air service since the 1980s. Allegheny County Airport ( IATA : AGC ) in suburban West Mifflin, Pennsylvania , is the area's largest general aviation airport. The historic landmark, art deco terminal was the main passenger airport for the area until 1952. Allegheny opened in 1931 as the nation's third-largest and first with "hard surface" runways.
