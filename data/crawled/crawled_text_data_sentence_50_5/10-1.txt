Main articles: Pittsburgh Light Rail , Red Line (Pittsburgh) , Blue Line (Pittsburgh) , and Silver Line (Pittsburgh) The light rail network is a direct descendant of the original streetcar system , which once numbered dozens of lines and included interurban routes to neighboring cities such as Washington and Charleroi . The current network comprises five routes on 25 miles (40 km) of track, operated by modern articulated light rail vehicles . Although most is on dedicated right-of-way, including the Mt. Washington Transit Tunnel , trains still street run in the Beechview neighborhood. Once across the Monongahela River trains enter a subway to serve Downtown Pittsburgh . Since March 2012, the North Shore Connector has extended service across the Allegheny River, via tunnel, to such destinations as PNC Park , Heinz Field , and Rivers Casino .

The latter use high-speed articulated buses that run at grade and above ground on their own right-of-way with platform stations, much like a rail system. In some instances, such as the Mount Washington tunnel, these buses travel along paved sections of the light rail line. There are currently three routes: the South Busway , from downtown to the southern part of Allegheny County, the Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway , from the Amtrak station to the eastern suburbs, and the West Busway , to the western suburbs. Future plans include extending the West Busway to the Pittsburgh International Airport . All light rail/busway stations outside the downtown have PAT station shuttles that serve the surrounding neighborhoods, and sections of the metropolitan area not served by the light rail/busway system, including most of the northern suburbs, have regular PAT bus routes. The mass transit systems of Beaver , Fayette , Lawrence , Washington , and Westmoreland counties (including Mid Mon Valley Transit Authority ) operate their own commuter shuttles to and from the city; the private company Myers Coach Line operates commuter service from Butler County. [ 7 ] The mass transit system of Monongalia County, West Virginia also provides connections to Pittsburgh. In early 2005 the Southwestern Pennsylvania Commission proposed combining Pittsburgh Regional Transit, then known as Port Authority, with the nine surrounding metro counties transit agencies.

[ 11 ] Other Pittsburgh area airports [ edit ] General aviation is served by the Allegheny County Airport . Its terminal is of a 1920s art-deco design. It once hosted Charles Lindbergh and handles 139,000 private and corporate-jet flights a year. A secondary reliever airport is in the eastern suburb of Latrobe, Pennsylvania . Over the last few decades the Arnold Palmer Regional Airport has been served by 2-3 daily flights from US Airways , Northwest Airlines / Delta Air Lines , and presently Spirit Airlines , as well as serving as a general aviation hub for east hills communities. Other area airports include: North Metro : Butler County Airport Zelienople Municipal Airport Rock Airport New Castle Municipal Airport Lakehill Airport South Metro : Allegheny County Airport Rostraver Airport Joseph A. Hardy Connellsville Airport Washington County Airport East Metro : Arnold Palmer Regional Airport Greensburg Jeannette Regional Airport Indiana County-Jimmy Stewart Airport West Metro : Beaver County Airport Eddie Dew Memorial Airpark (Ohio) Jefferson County Airpark (Ohio) Herron Airport (West Virginia) Wheeling Airport (West Virginia) Pedestrians and bicycling [ edit ] Trails [ edit ] Unpaved portion of the Three Rivers Heritage Trail in Strip District Pittsburgh has a thriving cycling community despite steep hills and variable weather. Efforts have been made to incorporate the bicycle into the transportation system. The Three Rivers Heritage Trail encompasses all the trails in the city. The Eliza Furnace Trail, known locally as the "Jail Trail", stretches from Downtown (at the Allegheny County Jail) to the East End region, where trail access can be found along some roads. The North Shore Trail spans from the Alcosan plant along the Ohio River and continues along the Allegheny River to Millvale. The Southside Trail follows the Monongahela River and beyond Baldwin Borough connects to McKeesport via the Great Allegheny Passage . This trail, in connection with the C&O Canal Trail , forms a continuous motorist-free route from Point State Park in Pittsburgh to Washington, D.C. PAT has installed bike racks on all buses and it allows bikes on its subway/busway system at all times. Healthy Ride station Bike Pittsburgh (BikePGH) is the local bicycle advocacy group and is working to make Pittsburgh increasingly safe, accessible, and friendly to bicycle transportation. The non-profit bike collective , Free Ride , recycles bicycles and bike parts, teaches bicycle construction, and has programs to sell or earn a rebuilt bicycle. Additionally, bicycles can be borrowed at two places along the Heritage Trail through the Friends of the Riverfront/Dasani Blue Bikes program. In 2014, the City began installing segregated bike lanes, which provide greater physical safety to the biker. [ 12 ] On September 6, bike lanes that stretch from Downtown Pittsburgh to the 16th Street Bridge on Penn Avenue were installed. In order to accommodate these bike lanes, the Westbound lane of Penn Avenue was removed, making it one way. Other segregated bike lanes were installed on Schenley Drive in Oakland, and Saline Street in Greenfield. [ 13 ] The " Healthy Ride " bicycle-sharing system entered service in Spring, 2016, supplied by Nextbike . Price is $2 per half-hour, or $12 or $20 per month. [ 14 ] Inclines and staircases [ edit ] Main articles: List of inclines in Pittsburgh and Steps of Pittsburgh Two inclines ascend Mount Washington : Duquesne Incline and Monongahela Incline . Pittsburgh had considerably more inclines and the Monongahela Incline was paralleled by a freight incline. [ citation needed ] Pittsburgh has more public staircases (737) than any other city in the United States, followed by Cincinnati and San Francisco . [ 15 ] Many of these staircases have street names , and lead to hillside neighborhoods that can be difficult to access by car in winter. Public staircase in Pittsburgh, ca. 1940 The Duquesne Incline . Freight Railroads [ edit ] During the heyday of the steel industry, Pittsburgh was among the largest rail centers not only in the nation, but the world. For many years, the multiple rail crossings in the suburb of Port Perry at the mouth of Turtle Creek on the Monongahela River and adjacent to the Edgar Thomson Works and Duquesne mills , was the highest concentration of freight traffic in the world. Even today, with river traffic included, Port Perry is often very near or at the top of the list. The Conway Yard to the west of the city along the Ohio River was the largest rail yard in the world from 1956 until 1980. From the beginning of the industrial era in America through its collapse in the 1980s, Pittsburgh was a key market for the nation's largest and most important railroads (most notably the Pennsylvania Railroad [the largest company in the world for much of the 20th century], and the New York Central Railroad [via the Pittsburgh & Lake Erie ], Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and Pittsburgh & West Virginia ). Despite the near-complete collapse of heavy industry in the Northeast, Pittsburgh remains an extremely important link in the nation's rail network. Current railroads in Pittsburgh include: Class I railroads [ edit ] Norfolk Southern (NS) [ edit ] Norfolk Southern operates the former assets of Conrail , composed of the Pennsylvania Railroad , instrumental in the formation of modern Pittsburgh. NS operates three lines through Pittsburgh: the original line, the Pittsburgh Line , from U.S. Steel's Edgar Thomson Steel Mill in Braddock, PA, over the Allegheny River near Downtown Pittsburgh, into Island Ave Yard where it becomes the Fort Wayne Line ; the Mon Line , along the south bank of the Monongahela River from West Brownsville, PA , to Island Ave Yard, formerly the Pittsburgh, Virginia and Charleston Railroad. This line is used by coal trains from southern Pennsylvania and trains with over-height cars that cannot fit under the roof of Penn Station on the Pittsburgh Line, accessing it via a branch just east of Braddock to the Port Perry bridge . The Mon Line joins the Fort Wayne Line at Island Ave Yard after crossing the Ohio River on the Ohio Connecting (OC) Railroad bridge ; the Conemaugh Line , along the north shore of the Allegheny River, serving several coal branch lines and power plants. Operations are centered on a small yard in Etna , PA. On the Mon and Pittsburgh lines over 60 trains a day pass through the city. CSX [ edit ] CSX operates the former Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O) and the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad (P&LE). Many of the old B&O lines have been removed or are unused.
