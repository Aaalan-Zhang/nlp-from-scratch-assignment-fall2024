Buses serve most of the county, extending as far as Pittsburgh International Airport , Monroeville , McCandless , and the borders of Westmoreland County and Beaver County, Pennsylvania . Meanwhile, the light rail system (commonly known as the "T") runs along both new tracks and those refurbished from the streetcar era. The light rail runs from Acrisure Stadium to South Hills Village and Library , taking commuters through one of two routes: one which serves Castle Shannon , Mt. Lebanon , and Beechview , and the other is an express line using railways through Overbrook . Freight rail [ edit ] Union Station , built in 1903 Pittsburgh's rail industry dates to 1851 when the Pennsylvania Railroad first opened service between the Pittsburgh and Philadelphia . The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad entered the city in 1871. In 1865, Andrew Carnegie opened the Pittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works , which manufactured for the industry until 1919. Carnegie also founded the Union Railroad in 1894 for heavy freight services and it still serves the area's steel industry, while George Westinghouse 's Wabtec has been a leader in rail engines and switching since 1869. Pittsburgh is home to one of Norfolk Southern Railway 's busiest freight corridors, the Pittsburgh Line , and operates up to 70 trains per day through the city. The suburban Conway Rail Yard , built in 1889, was the largest freight rail center in the world from 1956 until 1980 and is today the nation's second-largest. CSX , the other major freight railroad in the eastern U.S., also has major operations around Pittsburgh. Port [ edit ] The Port of Pittsburgh ranks as the 20th-largest port in the United States with almost 34 million short tons of river cargo for 2011, the port ranked ninth-largest in the U.S. when measured in domestic trade.

Due to its river valley and urban location as well as elevation, many of the summertime warm minima temperature records set at the WBO have not even come close to being matched at KPIT, which is at-elevation and located in the western suburbs.
