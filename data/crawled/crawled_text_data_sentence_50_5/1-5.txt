The rates of homeownership and cordial relationships between the steel company and Vandergrift residents fostered loyalty among McMurtry's skilled workers and led to McMurtry's greatest success. In 1901 he used Vandergrift's worker-residents to break the first major strike against the United States Steel Corporation . [ 43 ] Machine politics [ edit ] Christopher Magee and William Flinn operated powerful Republican machines that controlled local politics after 1880. They were business owners and favored business interests. Flinn was a leader of the Progressive movement statewide and supported Theodore Roosevelt in the 1912 election. [ 44 ] Germans [ edit ] During the mid-19th century, Pittsburgh witnessed a dramatic influx of German immigrants , including a brick mason whose son, Henry J. Heinz , founded the H.J. Heinz Company in 1869. Heinz was at the forefront of reform efforts to improve food purity, working conditions, hours, and wages, [ 45 ] but the company bitterly opposed the formation of an independent labor union. [ 46 ] Labor unions [ edit ] As a manufacturing center, Pittsburgh also became an arena for intense labor strife. During the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 , Pittsburgh workers protested and had massive demonstrations that erupted into widespread violence, known as the Pittsburgh Railway Riots . [ 47 ] Militia and federal troops were called to the city to suppress the strike. Forty men died, most of them workers, and more than 40 buildings were burned down, including the Union Depot of the Pennsylvania Railroad . Strikers also burned and destroyed rolling stock: more than 100 train engines and 1000 railcars were destroyed. It was the city with the most violence of any affected by the strikes. Burning of Pennsylvania Railroad and Union Depot, Pittsburgh, July 21–22, 1877 In 1892, a confrontation in the steel industry resulted in 10 deaths (3 detectives, 7 workers) when Carnegie Steel Company 's manager Henry Clay Frick sent in Pinkertons to break the Homestead Strike . Labor strife continued into the years of the Great Depression , as workers sought to protect their jobs and improve working conditions. Unions organized H.J. Heinz workers, with the assistance of the Catholic Radical Alliance . Carnegie [ edit ] Andrew Carnegie , an immigrant from Scotland and a former Pennsylvania Railroad executive turned steel magnate, founded the Carnegie Steel Company . He proceeded to play a key role in the development of the U.S. steel industry. He became a philanthropist: in 1890, he established the first Carnegie Library , in a program to establish libraries in numerous cities and towns by the incentive of matching funds. In 1895, he founded the Carnegie Institute . In 1901, as the U.S. Steel Corporation formed, he sold his mills to J.P. Morgan for $250 million, making him one of the world's richest men. Carnegie once wrote that a man who dies rich, dies disgraced. [ 48 ] He devoted the rest of his life to public service, establishing libraries, trusts, and foundations. In Pittsburgh, he founded the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University ) and the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh . [ 39 ] The third (and present) Allegheny County Courthouse and Jail was completed in 1886. In 1890, trolleys began operations. [ 27 ] In 1907, Pittsburgh annexed Allegheny City , which is now known as the North Side . [ 27 ] Steelworker watching molten steel being poured into a mold, J&L Steel, Pittsburgh, May 1942. Early 20th century [ edit ] By 1911, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial and commercial powerhouse: [ 21 ] Nexus of a vast railway system, with freight yards capable of handling 60K cars 27.2 miles (43.8 km) of harbor Yearly river traffic in excess of 9M tons Value of factory products more than $211M (with Allegheny City) Allegheny county produced, as percentage of national output, about: 24% of the pig iron 34% of the Bessemer steel 44% of the open hearth steel 53% of the crucible steel 24% of the steel rails 59% of the structural shapes Prohibition [ edit ] During the Prohibition era , 1920 to 1933, Pittsburgh was a hotbed of bootlegging and illicit alcohol consumption. [ 49 ] [ 50 ] Several factors fed into resistance to Prohibition, including a large immigrant population, anti-establishment animosity dating to the Whiskey Rebellion , fragmented local government, and pervasive corruption. [ 50 ] The Pittsburgh crime family controlled significant portions of the illegal alcohol trade. During that time, Prohibition Administrator John Pennington and his federal agents engaged in 15,000 raids, arrested over 18,000 people and closed down over 3,000 distilleries, 16 regular breweries, and 400 'wildcat' breweries. [ 50 ] [ 51 ] Even the term " Speakeasy ," meaning an illegal drinking establishment, is said to have been coined at the Blind Pig in nearby McKeesport, Pennsylvania . [ 50 ] [ 52 ] The last distillery in Pittsburgh, Joseph S. Finch's distillery, located at South Second and McKean streets, closed in the 1920s. [ 53 ] In 2012, Wigle Whiskey opened, becoming the first since the closure of Finch's distillery. [ 53 ] The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette produced a large web feature on this period in the city's history. [ 54 ] Environment [ edit ] During the late 19th century, city leaders debated the responsibility and expense of creating a waterworks system and disposal of sewage. Downstream users complained about Pittsburgh's dumping of sewage into the Ohio River. Allegheny County cities did not stop discharging raw sewage into rivers until 1939. Pittsburgh's smoke pollution, seen in the 1890s as a sign of prosperity, was recognized as a problem in the Progressive Era and was cleared up in the 1930s–1940s. Steel plants deposited mountains of slag until 1972, especially in Nine Mile Run Valley. [ 55 ] In November 1927, 28 people were killed and hundreds were wounded in an explosion of a gas tank. [ 56 ] To escape the soot of the city, many of the wealthy lived in the Shadyside and East End neighborhoods, a few miles east of downtown. Fifth Avenue was dubbed "Millionaire's Row" because of the many mansions lining the street. On March 17 and 18, 1936, Pittsburgh suffered the worst flood in its history, with flood levels peaking at 46 feet. This catastrophe killed 69 victims, destroyed thousands of buildings, caused $3B (2006 dollars) in damages, and put more than 60,000 steelworkers out of work. [ 57 ] High culture [ edit ] Oakland became the city's predominant cultural and educational center, including three universities, multiple museums, a library, a music hall, and a botanical conservatory. Oakland's University of Pittsburgh erected what today is still the world's fourth-tallest educational building, the 42-story Cathedral of Learning . [ 58 ] It towered over Forbes Field , where the Pittsburgh Pirates played from 1909 to 1970. [ 39 ] Downtown Pittsburgh panorama, from 1920. New immigrants and migrants [ edit ] Between 1870 and 1920, the population of Pittsburgh grew almost sevenfold, with a large number of European immigrants arriving to the city. New arrivals continue to come from Britain, Ireland, and Germany, but the most popular sources after 1870 were poor rural areas in southern and eastern Europe, including Italy, the Balkans, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the Russian Empire. Unskilled immigrants found jobs in construction, mining, steel mills and factories. They introduced new traditions, languages, and cultures to the city, creating a diversified society as a result. Ethnic neighborhoods developed in working-class areas and were built on densely populated hillsides and valleys, such as South Side , Polish Hill , Bloomfield , and Squirrel Hill , home to 28% of the city's almost 21,000 Jewish households. [ 59 ] The Strip District , the city's produce distribution center, still boasts many restaurants and clubs that showcase these multicultural traditions of Pittsburghers. [ 39 ] African Americans [ edit ] Further information: Great Migration (African American) The years 1916–1940 marked the largest migration of African Americans to Pittsburgh during the Great Migration from the rural South to industrial cities of the Northeast and Midwest. These migrants came for industrial jobs, education, political and social freedom, and to escape racial oppression and violence in the South.
