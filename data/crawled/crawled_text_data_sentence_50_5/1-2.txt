[ 20 ] In the Battle of the Monongahela , the French inflicted heavy losses on the British, and Braddock was mortally wounded. [ 21 ] The surviving British and colonial forces retreated. This left the French and their Native American allies with dominion over the upper Ohio valley. [ 15 ] On September 8, 1756, an expedition of 300 militiamen destroyed the Shawnee and Lenape village of Kittanning , and in the summer of 1758, British Army officer John Forbes began a campaign to capture Fort Duquesne. [ 21 ] At the head of 7,000 regular and colonial troops, Forbes built Fort Ligonier and Fort Bedford , from where he cut a wagon road over the Allegheny Mountains, later known as Forbes' Road. On the night of September 13–14, 1758, an advance column under Major James Grant was annihilated in the Battle of Fort Duquesne . [ 21 ] The battleground, the high hill east of the Point, was named Grant's Hill in his memory. With this defeat, Forbes decided to wait until spring. But when he heard that the French had lost Fort Frontenac and largely evacuated Fort Duquesne , he planned an immediate attack. Hopelessly outnumbered, the French abandoned and razed Fort Duquesne. Forbes occupied the burned fort on November 25, 1758, and ordered the construction of Fort Pitt , named after British Secretary of State William Pitt the Elder . He also named the settlement between the rivers, "Pittsborough" (see Etymology of Pittsburgh ). [ 11 ] [ 15 ] The British garrison at Fort Pitt made substantial improvements to its fortification. [ 11 ] The French never attacked Fort Pitt and the war soon ended with the Treaty of Paris and French defeat. [ 15 ] They ceded their territories east of the Mississippi River. Gateway to the West (1763–1799) [ edit ] In 1760, the first considerable European settlement around Fort Pitt began to grow. Traders and settlers built two groups of houses and cabins, the "lower town," near the fort's ramparts, and the "upper town," along the Monongahela as far as present-day Market Street. In April 1761, a census ordered by Colonel Henry Bouquet and conducted by William Clapham counted 332 people and 104 houses. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] : 148 After Britain's victory in the French and Indian War, increasing dissatisfaction among Native Americans with the continuing encroachment of settlers on lands that had been agreed would be Indian-occupied (both in the 1758 Treaty of Easton and in the Royal Proclamation of 1763 the British authorities had decreed that there would be no British-American settlements west of the Alleghenies, but the authorities had been unable or unwilling to enforce these decrees) led to the outbreak of Pontiac's War . The Odawa leader Pontiac launched an offensive against British forts in May 1763. Native American tribes from the Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes overran numerous British forts; one of their most important targets was Fort Pitt. Receiving warning of the coming attack, Captain Simeon Ecuyer, the Swiss officer in command of the garrison, prepared for a siege. He leveled the houses outside the ramparts and ordered all settlers into the fort: 330 men, 104 women, and 196 children sought refuge inside its ramparts. [ 11 ] Captain Ecuyer also gathered stores, which included hundreds of barrels of pork and beef. Pontiac's forces attacked the fort on June 22, 1763, and the siege of Fort Pitt lasted for two months. [ 15 ] Pontiac's warriors kept up a continuous, though ineffective, fire on it from July 27 through August 1, 1763. [ 21 ] They drew off to confront the relieving party under Colonel Bouquet, which defeated them in the Battle of Bushy Run . [ 21 ] This victory ensured British dominion over the forks of the Ohio, if not the entire Ohio valley. In 1764 Colonel Bouquet added a redoubt , the Fort Pitt Blockhouse , which still stands, the sole remaining structure from Fort Pitt and the oldest authenticated building west of the Allegheny Mountains . [ 15 ] Fort Pitt, 1795 The Iroquois signed the Fort Stanwix Treaty of 1768 , ceding the lands south of the Ohio to the British Crown . [ 21 ] European expansion into the upper Ohio valley increased. An estimated 4,000 to 5,000 families settled in western Pennsylvania between 1768 and 1770. Of these settlers, about a third were English-American , another third were Scotch-Irish , and the rest were Welsh , German and others. [ 23 ] These groups tended to settle together in small farming communities, but often their households were not within hailing distance. The life of a settler family was one of relentless hard work: clearing the forest, stumping the fields, building cabins and barns, planting, weeding, and harvesting. In addition, almost everything was manufactured by hand, including furniture, tools, candles, buttons, and needles. [ 23 ] Settlers had to deal with harsh winters, and with snakes, black bears, mountain lions, and timber wolves. Because of the fear of raids by Native Americans, the settlers often built their cabins near, or even on top of, springs, to ensure access to water. They also built blockhouses, where neighbors would rally during conflicts. [ 4 ] Increasing violence, especially by the Shawnee , Miami , and Wyandot tribes, led to Dunmore's War in 1774. Conflict with Native Americans continued throughout the Revolutionary War , as some hoped that the war would end with expulsion of the settlers from their territory. In 1777, Fort Pitt became a United States fort, when Brigadier General Edward Hand took command. In 1779, Colonel Daniel Brodhead led 600 men from Fort Pitt to destroy Seneca villages along the upper Allegheny. [ 4 ] With the war still ongoing, in 1780 Virginia and Pennsylvania came to an agreement on their mutual borders, creating the state lines known today and determining finally that the jurisdiction of Pittsburgh region was Pennsylvanian. In 1783, the Revolutionary War ended, which also brought at least a temporary cessation of border warfare. In the 1784 Treaty of Fort Stanwix , the Iroquois ceded the land north of the Purchase Line to Pennsylvania. [ 4 ] Map of Pittsburgh in 1795 After the Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building . Flatboats could be used to carry large numbers of pioneers and goods downriver, while keelboats were capable of traveling upriver. [ 24 ] The village began to develop vital institutions. Hugh Henry Brackenridge , a Pittsburgh resident and state legislator, introduced a bill that resulted in a gift deed of land and a charter for the Pittsburgh Academy on February 28, 1787. The academy later developed as the University of Western Pennsylvania (1819) and since 1908 has been known as the University of Pittsburgh . [ 25 ] Many farmers distilled their corn harvest into whiskey, increasing its value while lowering its transportation costs. At that time, whiskey was used as a form of currency on the frontier. When the federal government imposed an excise tax on whiskey, Western Pennsylvania farmers felt victimized, leading to the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794. Farmers from the region rallied at Braddock's Field and marched on Pittsburgh. The short-lived rebellion was put down, however, when President George Washington sent in militias from several states. [ 20 ] The town continued to grow in manufacturing capability. In 1792, the boatyards in Pittsburgh built a sloop, Western Experiment. [ 26 ] During the next decades, the yards produced other large boats.
