His successor, Bill Peduto , was sworn in on January 6, 2014. In November 2021, Pittsburgh elected its first African-American mayor, Ed Gainey . Prior to the American Civil War , Pittsburgh was strongly abolitionist. It is considered the birthplace of the national Republican Party , [ 241 ] as the party held its first convention here in February 1856. From the Civil War to the 1930s, Pittsburgh was a Republican stronghold. The effects of the Great Depression , combined with entrenched local GOP scandals, resulted in a shift among voters to the Democratic Party. With the exceptions of the 1973 and 1977 elections (where lifelong Democrats ran off the party ticket), Democrats have been elected consecutively to the mayor's office since the 1933 election . The city's ratio of party registration is 5 to 1 Democrat. [ 242 ] Pittsburgh is represented in the Pennsylvania General Assembly by three Senate Districts ( Lindsey Williams (D)- 38 , Wayne D.

[ 246 ] In Pittsburgh, the homicide rate for African Americans is seven times the national average. [ 247 ] Some people believe that over-reliance on law enforcement exacerbates homicide rates. [ 247 ] There is also concern regarding the effectiveness of law enforcement in solving these cases, as 97% of unsolved cases involved a black victim. [ 248 ] This has led certain residents to believe law enforcement to be ineffective or apathetic. [ 248 ] This is despite an increasing police budget. In 2023, members of the Pittsburgh City Council approved an increase to the police budget by $6 million. [ 249 ] About 6% of this money is expected to go to the Stop the Violence trust fund. This fund goes to improving parks and recreation, various non-profits, and to the office of Community Health and Safety, in effort to holistically improve the social pressures supposedly causing violence in Pittsburgh.
