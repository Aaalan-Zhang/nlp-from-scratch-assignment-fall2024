Twentieth century [ edit ] Pittsburgh Steel mill in Homestead circa 1907 In the early 20th century the economy of Pittsburgh was primarily driven by the steel industry and the city had reached a population 321,616 . [ 28 ] Throughout this period , Pittsburgh would see a spike in population and a slow decline at the end of the century . At one point Pittsburgh was the eighth-largest city in America . [ citation needed ] In 1901 , The Amalgamated Association of Iron , Steel and Tin Workers organized a general strike against the U.S. Steel Corporation subsidiaries , the first strike since 1892 . [ 29 ] A 1903 Pittsburgh Press front page highlighted the city 's being a focus point for three different railroads . [ 30 ] In 1911 the city was being referred to as the `` Stogie capital of the nation '' with several high quality cigar manufacturers located in the region . [ 31 ] Pittsburgh produced around one third of the national output of steel by the 1920s . During this period Pittsburgh was home to the world 's largest tube and pipe mill , structural steel plant , rail mill , wire manufacturing plant , bridge and construction fabricating plant . [ 32 ] `` Boat building and metal industries were later the economic base of the region . When coke from coal began to replace charcoal from wood in iron and steel making Pittsburgh grew up as the heart of the industry . A plentiful supply of bituminous coal underlies the Pittsburgh area . '' [ 33 ] Around forty percent of the nation 's coal was obtained from within 100 miles of Pittsburgh . [ 32 ] Due to the reforms of Franklin Roosevelt 's New Deal , steel unions gained success in Pittsburgh . The Wagner Act of 1935 gave employees rights to self-organize in labor unions and made it unlawful for employers to prevent or interfere with such unions . [ 34 ] By the 1950s industrial leaders worked with regional government leaders to foster and retain more local industry ; organizations such as the RIDC were formed to further this goal . [ 35 ] [ 36 ] However , in the early to mid-1980s the steel industry collapsed , leaving half of the nation 's steelworkers unemployed . [ 37 ] `` The number of steel workers in the Pittsburgh area dropped from 90,000 in 1980 to 44,000 in just four years '' . [ 38 ] Motor Coils manufacturing company of suburban Forest Hills and Braddock has been a leading supplier to American railroads since 1957 . [ 39 ] Pittsburgh was a major center for advertising and public relations firms in the 20th century such as Ketchum and Burson-Marsteller . [ 40 ] Retail chains such as G. C. Murphy , Thrift Drug , Thorofare , Fisher 's Big Wheel and Giant Eagle were founded in the early part of the 20th century with Phar-Mor dominating local retail from the 1980s to the 2000s . Thorofare ceased operations in 1982 and Thrift Drug was bought out by Eckerd in 1996 . Local stores of Loblaws closed in 1958 , Kroger in 1966 ( although it retains stores in nearby West Virginia counties ) and A & P in 1972 . [ 41 ] IGA closed its area stores in the early 2000s . [ 42 ] Transition into the present economy [ edit ] Within the transitional years between 1970 and 1990 , Pittsburgh 's Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area saw shifts in its main employers , which were the manufacturing sector . In 1970 , one out of every three jobs was in the manufacturing sector . By 1980 this had slipped to one in four . In 1980 , the average production worker in manufacturing was making $ 360.89 weekly , which was almost $ 70 more than the state and national average . During this period the largest group of occupational employment was blue collar . This group in 1980 accounted for almost 68 percent of the jobs market . In the 1980s , a decline in the manufacturing industry was expected . The accepted trend was that Pittsburgh would embrace “ industrial robots ” . Since 1955 Pittsburgh has seen a steady decline in manufacturing employment . In 1955 Pittsburgh had a population of 41.8 percent in the manufactory business . In 1980 that number had slipped to almost 25.3 percent . [ 43 ] Allegheny County is the center for health care and higher education employment . Higher education and health care were the biggest creators of high-wage [ clarification needed ] jobs in the Pittsburgh region between 1999 and 2005 . Education accounts for almost 80 % of high-wage jobs in Allegheny County . The Pittsburgh area has seen growth in other sectors as well . Professional services , finance and wholesale trade were among the growing sectors . However , much of this growth was outside the borders of Allegheny County .
