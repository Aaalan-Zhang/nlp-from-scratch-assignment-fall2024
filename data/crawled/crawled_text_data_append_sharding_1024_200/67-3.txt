screaming that Turiddu has been killed . PAGLIACCI PROLOGUE Tonio the clown announces that what the audience is about to see is a true story and that actors have the same joys and sorrows as other people . ACT I The same Sicilian village , 1949 . A small theatrical company has just arrived and Canio , the head of the troupe , advertises the night ’ s performance to the gathered crowd . One of the villagers suggests that Tonio is secretly courting Canio ’ s young wife , Nedda . Canio warns them all that he will not tolerate any flirting offstage—life and theater are not the same . As the crowd disperses , Nedda is left alone , disturbed by her husband ’ s jealousy . She looks up to the sky , envying the birds their freedom . Tonio appears and tries to force himself on Nedda , but she beats him back , and he retreats , swearing revenge . In fact , Nedda does have a lover—Silvio , a young peasant , who suddenly appears . The two reaffirm their love , and Silvio persuades Nedda to run away with him that night . Tonio , who has returned and overheard the end of their conversation , alerts Canio , but Silvio manages to slip away unrecognized . Canio violently threatens Nedda , but she refuses to reveal her lover ’ s name . Beppe , another member of the troupe , restrains Canio , and Tonio advises him to wait until the evening ’ s performance to catch the culprit . Alone , Canio gives in to his despair—he must play the clown even though his heart is breaking . ACT II That evening , the villagers assemble to watch the performance , Silvio among them . Beppe plays Harlequin , who serenades Columbine , played by Nedda . He dismisses her buffoonish servant Taddeo , played by Tonio , and over dinner the two sweethearts plot to poison Columbine ’ s husband Pagliaccio , played by Canio . When Pagliaccio unexpectedly appears , Harlequin slips away . Taddeo maliciously assures Pagliaccio of his wife ’ s innocence , which ignites Canio ’ s jealousy . Forgetting his role and the play , he demands that Nedda tell him the name of her lover . She tries to continue with the performance , the audience enthralled by its realism , until Canio snaps . In a fit of rage he stabs Nedda and then Silvio , who rushes to her aid . Turning to the horrified crowd , Tonio announces that the comedy is over .
