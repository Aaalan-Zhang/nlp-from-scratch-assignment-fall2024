) Con Alma Pittsburgh 's jazz legacy is a story we love to tell at VisitPITTSBURGH . While the most famous venues on the Hill District that helped spawn countless careers are now closed , Con Alma Downtown keeps this heritage alive . Every night of the week , Con Alma has world-class jazz musicians playing just feet away from a top-ranked bar and food that is consistently named one of the best bites in the Burgh . MCG Jazz Furthering our jazz legacy each month are the talented acts brought in by MCG Jazz , a 350-seat venue that brings in legends and emerging artists of the scene . MCG Jazz usually hosts a few shows per month , and audiophiles will love the attention to fidelity in this venue , which regularly churns out incredible albums and live recordings ( albums produced here have won 5 GRAMMY awards ) .

This in turn attracts the attention nationally touring DJs , EDM artists and more that fill out their concerts list , with house DJs and other special events making each weekend a party .

Live music also happens multiple times per week in their tasting room , allowing you to see local performers and national touring acts all in one piece while you enjoy some of the best wine in the state .

This movie theatre is still a great place to catch a special screening , but The Oaks Theater has evolved into a happening live music space bringing in local powerhouses and national acts which quickly sell out . Stay in the know on their events page .

And , with a stunning beer selection and great wings , you 'll see why this neighborhood hotspot is less of a hidden gem each week .

During warmer months , this is the place to see tons of national touring acts outside and with a nice lawn space . During colder months , the indoor vibe here can still fit major acts with incredible sound fidelity and lighting , or scaled all the way down to their Club at Stage AE experience for smaller acts . Besides Smalls and Roxian , this is the venue I probably end up going to the most . There 's a huge variety of genres that pass through here and the live experience somehow manages to still feel intimate even with 5,000 others around you . Pro Tip : Add the Quick Pass to your tickets and avoid waiting in line hours in advance to get to the front row for GA shows . This add on gives you your own line and easy entry to the venue .
