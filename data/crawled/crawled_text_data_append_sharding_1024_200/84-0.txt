Kim Bond : We Are Not Alone Sep 6 , 2024 - Jan 12 , 2025 707 Gallery 707 Penn Avenue Pittsburgh , PA 15222 EVENT WEBSITE For nearly four decades , Kim Bond ( b . 1963 , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania ) has explored the intersections of paranormal phenomena and the pursuit of a kinder , more inclusive world through her multidisciplinary practice encompassing drawings , paintings , sculptures , and writings . Bond 's oeuvre is characterized by the integration of extraterrestrial imagery , including aliens , spacecraft , and Sasquatch , into natural environments such as the Colorado Mountains , Niagara Falls , Lake Erie , and Mt . St. Helena . These entities , with whom Bond professes communication , are depicted in tranquil landscapes , symbolizing hope and moral integrity . Another series depicts “ The Rainbow Club , ” Bond 's vision for a utopian social venue that welcomes all beings , transcending barriers of gender , ability , age , and even species . In a fragmented society , Bond 's work envisions a harmonious realm where diversity is not only accepted but celebrated . Bond initially honed her artistic skills and developed her unique aesthetic language through exposure to The Joy of Painting , a groundbreaking instructional television program created by Bob Ross that aired from 1983 to 1994 on PBS . The Joy of Painting democratized access to arts education , including individuals with disabilities . Airing on public television , the show allowed people to learn how to paint from their homes , eliminating both cost barriers and the need for physical attendance in classes .
