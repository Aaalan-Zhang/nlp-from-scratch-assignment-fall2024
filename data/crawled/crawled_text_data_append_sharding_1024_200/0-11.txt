. [ 112 ] Though lead levels had been rising in previous years , they had not exceeded the legal limit . [ 110 ] In late 2015 PWSA terminated its contracted with Veolia . [ 111 ] In response to the high lead levels PWSA began adding orthophosphate to the water . [ 113 ] Orthophosphate is meant to create a coating on the inside of pipes , creating a barrier to prevent lead from leaching into drinking water . [ 113 ] PWSA has also been working to replace lead pipes , and continuing to test water for lead . [ 113 ] There remains concern among residents over the long-term effects of this lead , particularly for children , in whom lead causes permanent damage to the brain and nervous system . [ 114 ] Some people also believe that the high levels of lead reflect environmental racism , as black and Hispanic children in Pittsburgh experience elevated blood-lead levels at 4 times the rate of white children . [ 114 ] Water fountains in Langley k-8 school in Sheraden were found to have the highest levels of lead of any schools in the Pittsburgh area . These levels were about 11 times the legal limit . Some residents believe this is due to Langely being a predominantly black school , with 89 % of the student body being eligible for the free lunch program .
