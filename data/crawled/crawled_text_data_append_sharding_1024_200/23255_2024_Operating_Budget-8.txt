are funded primarily by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) . These funds are earmarked for projects relating to housing , economic development , and human services needs in neighborhoods with a high concentration of low- to moderate-income households . Special Revenue Funds are funds in which a substantial portion of the proceeds or inflows are restricted or committed for a specific purpose . Examples of these include the Liquid Fuels Fund , the Pittsburgh Partnership Fund , and the Grants Fund . While they are included in this document , the City only sets formal appropriations for two of the funds : the Stop the Violence Fund , and the Parks Tax Fund . Although many of these include the word “ trust ” in their titles , this is more of an informal recognition that the funds are designated for special purposes ; the funds are not held by any trustees or custodians . Fiduciary Funds are used to account for resources held for the benefit of parties outside the government . These resources are not available to support the City of Pittsburgh ’ s own operations and are custodial in nature . The City ’ s pension plans and its agency funds fall under this type of fund . • The City administers three pensions for full time employees : one for police officers , a second for firefighters , and a third for municipal employees . • Agency funds include accounts held for employee benefits , payroll withholding , escheats , and tax refunds . The Workers Compensation VEBA ( Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Account ) , the OPEB ( Other Post-Employment Benefits ) Trust Fund , and Real Estate Tax Refunds Trust Funds are examples of Fiduciary Funds .
