and reporting processes . The mission of the Grants Office is to increase the City ’ s capacity to compete for federal , state , county , corporate , and foundation grants and to effectively assist in the full life-cycle of grant management from award through closeout . The aim is to increase grant-related revenue , limit the City ’ s exposure to any grant-related legal liability , and improve the efficiency and impact of programs and services funded through grant dollars . The Grants Office helps departments find and apply for grant opportunities , thereby allowing each department to expand its overall capacity without placing greater burden on the City ’ s Operating and Capital budgets . Grant funds received by the City of Pittsburgh support important programs and services that the City provides to our community . These funds allow the City to extend pre-existing services , introduce new initiatives , gain technological advances , and subsidize programmatic staffing and equipment . Grant funds are dispersed throughout the City and impact a variety of efforts , including public safety , economic development , social services , recreation , and infrastructure improvement and maintenance , among many others . Because grant funding allows the City to leverage local public funds in order to extend and enhance the services it offers to the community , the impact of grant funding upon the City of Pittsburgh is significant . In 2023 , the City of Pittsburgh was awarded 31 new awards for a total of $ 31,823,429 in funding . Some projects supported by this funding include the Reconnecting Communities grant for improvements in Manchester , funding to rehabilitate a downtown park , and safety improvements at the intersection of Liberty Avenue and the Bloomfield Bridge supported by a State grant award ..
