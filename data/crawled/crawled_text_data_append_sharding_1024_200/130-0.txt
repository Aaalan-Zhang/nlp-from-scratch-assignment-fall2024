The organization is headquartered in the Carnegie Institute and Library complex in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh . The Carnegie Institute complex , which includes the original museum , recital hall , and library , was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 30 , 1979 . Portfolio [ edit ] Two of the Carnegie museums , the Carnegie Museum of Natural History and the Carnegie Museum of Art , are both located in the Carnegie Institute and Library complex in Oakland , a landmark building listed on the National Register of Historic Places ( ref # 79002158 , added 1979 ) . It also houses the Carnegie Music Hall and the main branch of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh . [ 3 ] Motto `` Free to the people '' above the Carnegie Library entrance Andrew Carnegie donated the library and the buildings . With the goal of inspiring people to do good for themselves and their communities , the terms for donations required communities to support them in exchange for the building and initial investment by Carnegie . The words `` free to the people '' inscribed above the entrance of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh illustrate his vision . [ 4 ] The other two museums , The Andy Warhol Museum and the Kamin Science Center , are located in separate facilities on Pittsburgh 's North Shore . [ 5 ] Andy Warhol Museum [ edit ] Main article : The Andy Warhol Museum Andy Warhol Museum Opened on May 15 , 1994 , the Andy Warhol Museum is the first museum to exclusively focus on an American postwar artist . [ 6 ] The building which houses the Andy Warhol Museum was originally built in 1911 for industrial purposes , but was redesigned for the museum by architect Richard Gluckman . The museum currently has seven floors of gallery and exhibition space as well as an underground education studio and conservation lab . [ 7 ] Warhol 's primary artistic technique was silkscreen pop art , which he gained notoriety for in the early 1960s . The serial images derived from the culture 's consumerism and conception of beauty are reified in a form of art which represent the identity of constituents in postwar American society . [ 8 ] Images used by Warhol , which have made him famous for his contributions to pop art , include celebrities and consumables such as Marilyn Monroe and The Campbell 's soup can . The museum 's collection includes over 4,000 Warhol art works in all media — paintings , drawings , prints , photographs , sculptures , and installation ; the entire Andy Warhol Video Collection , 228 four-minute Screen Tests , and 45 other films by Warhol ; and extensive archives , including Warhol 's Time Capsules . While dedicated to Andy Warhol , the museum also hosts many exhibits by contemporary artists . [ 9 ] Carnegie Museum of Art [ edit ] Main article : Carnegie Museum of Art Carnegie Museum of Art 's Sarah Scaife Gallery annex . Designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes and Associates .

The museum was founded as the Department of Fine Arts , Carnegie Institute in 1895 . The name was changed to its current name in [ 11 ] 1986 . Today the museum continues showcasing contemporary art by staging the Carnegie International exhibition every three to five years .
