Contemporary Craft
5645 Butler Street, Pittsburgh
Lawrenceville
Free
Exhibits
In its new exhibition, “芸[Gei]: The Beauty of Ephemeral and Eternal”, Contemporary Craft invites viewers to explore the captivating duality between the beauty of Ikebana – traditional Japanese flower arrangement – and the eternal nature of well-crafted objects. Four artists engage with members of Sogetsu Ikebana Pittsburgh, sparking contemplation of time, materiality, and heritage. This dialogue illuminates profound connections in Japanese culture that are woven throughout these art forms, harmonizing impermanence and eternity in Japan’s cultural tapestry - bridging past, present, and future. Featured artists include Tadao Arimoto, Carol Kumata, Miwa Neishi, and Yoko Sekino-Bové.

White Noise
Mondays-Fridays, 10 a.m.-4:30 p.m. Continues through Nov. 5
Robert Morris University Media Arts Gallery
6001 University Blvd, Wheatley Center, Moon Township
Moon
Free
Visual Art
"White Noise" by Kerry Skarbakka is a powerful exploration of toxic masculinity, an issue of great relevance in today's divided socio-political landscape. Originally conceived before the 2016 elections out of concern for his newborn son under a Trump presidency, this multi-media installation serves as both a warning and a reflection as we approach the 2024 elections. The exhibition features large format photographs, video, and sculptures, portraying a fictional white male's descent rooted in Skarbakka’s own experiences, touching on themes like anti-government sentiment, tribalism, and religious extremism.

Becoming a wizard isn’t easy. You’ve traveled to the magic school and taken the admissions exam, but didn’t pass. As a result, a horrible curse has been placed on you to ensure you don’t attempt further magic as a muggle.
Your train ride home has been summoned, but the door to the wizarding world is within reach. Can you reverse the curse and prove that you have the skills to join the wizarding school before your ride home arrives?
