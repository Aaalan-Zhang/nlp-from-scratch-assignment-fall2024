25 , 1922 on what would have been Andrew Carnegie 's 87th birthday . [ 21 ] Until 1957 , the band was male only , but in that year a female flutist joined and by 1961 there were eleven young women in the band . [ 22 ] In the early nineties the band , under the direction of Paul Gerlach who was known as the Director For Life without the Possibility for Parole , started a new tradition within the band . Drawing inspiration from the critically acclaimed 1975 film , Monty Python and the Holy Grail , a trumpeter of the band ( Ray Strobel ) , wrote an arrangement of King Arthur 's Quest for the band . To this day , a King takes to the track every home game between the third and fourth quarters , to quest for the Grail , with his loyal steed , Patsy . [ 21 ] The Kiltie Marching Band consists of musicians and colorguard and plays at all Carnegie Mellon home football games . There is a new show every week with music ranging from traditional marches and oldies to current pop tunes and jazz standards . After football season , the Kiltie Concert Band plays a holiday concert and two spring concerts , including a performance at Carnegie Mellon ’ s Spring Carnival . Additionally , a part of the band gets together and acts as a pep band for the basketball teams . Membership is open to all members of the campus/community without audition . Participants must do their best to promote the success of the ensemble through attendance , attitude , and dependability .
