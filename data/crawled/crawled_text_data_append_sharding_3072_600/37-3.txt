[ 50 ] 2005–2007 : Interregnum [ edit ] With the 2005–2006 season , the PSO introduced a different model for artistic leadership . During this time , a new collective bargaining agreement was in effect , which gave the musicians increased authority over matters of running the orchestra , such as the hiring of musicians and choice of repertoire . Starting in 2005 , Sir Andrew Davis served as the PSO artistic advisor , with Yan Pascal Tortelier as principal guest conductor and Marek Janowski holding the `` endowed guest conductor chair . '' Sir Andrew Davis , while providing overall programming input regarding the entire season and leading the orchestra in a variety of styles , paid special attention to the music of British and American composers . Davis had been an organ scholar before becoming a conductor . Under his direction , the Symphony performed many symphonic , operatic , and choral works ranging from baroque to contemporary . [ 51 ] Davis , a Knight Bachelor of Great Britain and music director of the Lyric Opera of Chicago , had previously led the Pittsburgh Symphony several times as a guest conductor between 1977 and 1990 . [ 52 ] Davis was originally scheduled to step down after the 2007–2008 season , but in October 2007 , Davis and the Pittsburgh Symphony mutually agreed to terminate his contract early and for him not to conduct his scheduled concerts in the 2007–2008 season because of increased demands on Davis ' schedule . [ 53 ] The contracts of Tortelier and Janowski also expired in 2008 . [ 54 ] Janowski now holds the Otto Klemperer Guest Conductor Chair with the PSO . 2008–present : Manfred Honeck [ edit ] In May 2006 , Manfred Honeck first guest-conducted the PSO . He returned for another guest appearance in November 2006 . In January 2007 , the PSO announced the appointment of Manfred Honeck as its ninth music director , effective with the 2008–2009 season , in a reversion of conductor leadership format to the traditional music director hierarchy . [ 55 ] [ 56 ] His initial contract was for three years . In September 2009 , the PSO announced the extension of Honeck 's contract to the 2015–2016 season . [ 57 ] In February 2012 , the PSO announced the further extension of Honeck 's contract through the 2019–2020 season . [ 58 ] In June 2007 , the orchestra announced the appointment of American conductor Leonard Slatkin as the orchestra 's principal guest conductor for the 2008–2009 season . [ 59 ] [ 60 ] In November 2006 , the PSO announced a pledge of $ 29.5 million from the Richard P. Simmons family as the start of a capital challenge for the orchestra to address long-standing financial concerns . [ 61 ] In December 2006 , the PSO announced the launch of an $ 80 million capital fund-raising drive after the initial $ 29.5 million boost from the Simmons family . [ 62 ] In March 2009 , the PSO announced the discontinuation of its chamber orchestra series after the 2008–2009 season , along with staff reductions of 9 positions . [ 63 ] In September 2009 , the Pittsburgh Symphony and Honeck agreed to extend his contract through the 2015–2016 season . In February 2012 , the PSO announced the further extension of Honeck 's contract through the 2019–2020 season .
