Sports in Pittsburgh have been played dating back to the American Civil War . Baseball , hockey , and the first professional American football game had been played in the city by 1892 . Pittsburgh was first known as the `` City of Champions '' when the Pittsburgh Pirates , Pittsburgh Panthers football team , and Pittsburgh Steelers won multiple championships in the 1970s . [ 1 ] Today , the city has three major professional sports franchises , the Pirates , Steelers , and Penguins ; while the University of Pittsburgh Panthers compete in a Division I Power Five conference , the highest level of collegiate athletics in the United States , in both football and basketball . Local universities Duquesne and Robert Morris also field Division I teams in men 's and women 's basketball and Division I FCS teams in football . Robert Morris also fields Division I men 's and women 's ice hockey teams . Pittsburgh 's major teams have seen great success , with the MLB 's Pirates winning 5 World Series titles , the NHL 's Penguins winning 5 Stanley Cups , and the NFL 's Steelers winning a tied league record 6 Super Bowls . The Pittsburgh Panthers have also been successful in the NCAA with 9 national championships in football and 2 in basketball . The flag of Pittsburgh is colored with black and gold , based on the colors of William Pitt 's coat of arms ; Pittsburgh is the only city in the United States in which all professional sporting teams share the same colors . The city 's first National Hockey League ( NHL ) franchise , the Pittsburgh Pirates , and that team 's non-NHL predecessor , the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets , wore black and gold as their colors in the 1920s . The colors were adopted by founder of the Pittsburgh Steelers , Art Rooney , in 1933 . In 1948 , the Pittsburgh baseball Pirates switched their colors from red and blue to black and gold . Pittsburgh 's second NHL franchise , the Pittsburgh Penguins , wore blue and white , due to then-general manager Jack Riley 's upbringing in Ontario . In 1979 , after the Steelers and Pirates had each won their respective league championships , the Penguins altered their color scheme to match , despite objections from the Boston Bruins , [ 2 ] [ 3 ] who have used the black and gold combination since the 1935â€“36 NHL season . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] In 1975 , late Steelers radio broadcaster Myron Cope invented the Terrible Towel , which has become `` arguably the best-known fan symbol of any major pro sports team . '' [ 6 ] Cope was one of multiple sports figures born in Pittsburgh and its surrounding area ; others include golfer Arnold Palmer , Olympian Kurt Angle , and basketball player Jack Twyman . Pittsburgh is also sometimes called the `` Cradle of Quarterbacks '' [ 7 ] [ 8 ] due to the number of prominent players of that position who hail from the area , including NFL greats Jim Kelly , George Blanda , Johnny Unitas , Joe Namath , Dan Marino , and Joe Montana . The hometown Pittsburgh Penguins NHL ice hockey team defeats the Washington Capitals in Game 7 of the 2017 Stanley Cup playoffs second round en route to winning the Stanley Cup championship two rounds later .
