vision was two-pronged : the arts could serve as a catalyst for economic , commercial and residential development of Downtown Pittsburgh , while enriching the quality of life for residents and visitors alike . When other U.S. cities abandoned their respective downtowns for strip malls and big-box stores , Pittsburgh ’ s Cultural District preserved its historical significance by leveraging the power of the arts to create an authentic destination that draws over two million visitors , arts lovers , students , residents and employers to over 1,500 events each year . The District includes Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre , Pittsburgh CLO , the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust , Pittsburgh Opera , Pittsburgh Public Theater , Pittsburgh Symphony and August Wilson Center for African American Culture , among hundreds of other arts groups and artists . The Cultural District is also home to the city ’ s High School for Creative and Performing Arts . Unlike other cities that house cultural activity within a single performing arts center , Pittsburgh ’ s Cultural District comprises 14 blocks that were holistically developed with the creation of multiple theaters , art galleries , public art projects , urban parks and riverfront recreation spaces .
