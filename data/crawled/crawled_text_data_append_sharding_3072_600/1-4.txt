, stumping the fields , building cabins and barns , planting , weeding , and harvesting . In addition , almost everything was manufactured by hand , including furniture , tools , candles , buttons , and needles . [ 23 ] Settlers had to deal with harsh winters , and with snakes , black bears , mountain lions , and timber wolves . Because of the fear of raids by Native Americans , the settlers often built their cabins near , or even on top of , springs , to ensure access to water . They also built blockhouses , where neighbors would rally during conflicts . [ 4 ] Increasing violence , especially by the Shawnee , Miami , and Wyandot tribes , led to Dunmore 's War in 1774 . Conflict with Native Americans continued throughout the Revolutionary War , as some hoped that the war would end with expulsion of the settlers from their territory . In 1777 , Fort Pitt became a United States fort , when Brigadier General Edward Hand took command . In 1779 , Colonel Daniel Brodhead led 600 men from Fort Pitt to destroy Seneca villages along the upper Allegheny . [ 4 ] With the war still ongoing , in 1780 Virginia and Pennsylvania came to an agreement on their mutual borders , creating the state lines known today and determining finally that the jurisdiction of Pittsburgh region was Pennsylvanian . In 1783 , the Revolutionary War ended , which also brought at least a temporary cessation of border warfare . In the 1784 Treaty of Fort Stanwix , the Iroquois ceded the land north of the Purchase Line to Pennsylvania . [ 4 ] Map of Pittsburgh in 1795 After the Revolution , the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow . One of its earliest industries was boat building . Flatboats could be used to carry large numbers of pioneers and goods downriver , while keelboats were capable of traveling upriver . [ 24 ] The village began to develop vital institutions . Hugh Henry Brackenridge , a Pittsburgh resident and state legislator , introduced a bill that resulted in a gift deed of land and a charter for the Pittsburgh Academy on February 28 , 1787 . The academy later developed as the University of Western Pennsylvania ( 1819 ) and since 1908 has been known as the University of Pittsburgh . [ 25 ] Many farmers distilled their corn harvest into whiskey , increasing its value while lowering its transportation costs . At that time , whiskey was used as a form of currency on the frontier . When the federal government imposed an excise tax on whiskey , Western Pennsylvania farmers felt victimized , leading to the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794 . Farmers from the region rallied at Braddock 's Field and marched on Pittsburgh . The short-lived rebellion was put down , however , when President George Washington sent in militias from several states . [ 20 ] The town continued to grow in manufacturing capability . In 1792 , the boatyards in Pittsburgh built a sloop , Western Experiment . [ 26 ] During the next decades , the yards produced other large boats . By the 19th century , they were building ocean-going vessels that shipped goods as far as Europe . In 1794 , the town 's first courthouse was built ; it was a wooden structure on Market Square . [ 11 ] In 1797 , the manufacture of glass began . [ 27 ] Year City Population [ 11 ] [ 21 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] : 80 [ 30 ] 1761 332 1796 1,395 1800 1,565 Iron City ( 1800–1859 ) [ edit ] Second Court House , completed 1841 [ 31 ] Commerce continued to be an essential part of the economy of early Pittsburgh , but increasingly , manufacture began to grow in importance . Pittsburgh was located in the middle of one of the most productive coalfields in the country ; the region was also rich in petroleum , natural gas , lumber , and farm goods . Blacksmiths forged iron implements , from horse shoes to nails . By 1800 , the town , with a population of 1,565 persons , had over 60 shops , including general stores , bakeries , and hat and shoe shops . [ 11 ] The 1810s were a critical decade in Pittsburgh 's growth . In 1811 , the first steamboat was built in Pittsburgh . Increasingly , commerce would also flow upriver . The War of 1812 catalyzed growth of the Iron City . The war with Britain , the manufacturing center of the world , cut off the supply of British goods , stimulating American manufacture . [ 11 ] In addition , the British blockade of the American coast increased inland trade , so that goods flowed through Pittsburgh from all four directions . By 1815 , Pittsburgh was producing $ 764K in iron ; $ 249K in brass and tin , and $ 235K in glass products . [ 11 ] When , on March 18 , 1816 , Pittsburgh was incorporated as a city , it had already taken on some of its defining characteristics : commerce , manufacture , and a constant cloud of coal dust . [ 32 ] Other emerging towns challenged Pittsburgh . In 1818 , the first segment of the National Road was completed , from Baltimore to Wheeling , bypassing Pittsburgh . This threatened to render the town less essential in east–west commerce . In the coming decade , however , many improvements were made to the transportation infrastructure . In 1818 , the region 's first river bridge , the Smithfield Street Bridge , opened , the first step in developing the `` City of bridges '' over its two rivers . [ citation needed ] On October 1 , 1840 , the original Pennsylvania Turnpike was completed , connecting Pittsburgh and the eastern port city of Philadelphia .
