[ 204 ] Local dialect [ edit ] Main article : Western Pennsylvania English The Pittsburgh English dialect , commonly called Pittsburghese , was influenced by Scots-Irish , German , and Eastern European immigrants and African Americans . [ 205 ] Locals who speak the dialect are sometimes referred to as `` Yinzers `` ( from the local word `` yinz '' [ var . yunz ] , a blended form of `` you ones '' , similar to `` y'all '' and `` you all '' in the South ) . Common Pittsburghese terms are : `` slippy '' ( slippery ) , `` redd up '' ( clean up ) , `` jagger bush '' ( thorn bush ) , and `` gum bands '' ( rubber bands ) . The dialect is also notable for dropping the verb `` to be '' . In Pittsburghese one would say `` the car needs washed '' instead of `` needs to be washed '' , `` needs washing '' , or `` needs a wash. '' The dialect has some tonal similarities to other nearby regional dialects of Erie and Baltimore but is noted for its somewhat staccato rhythms . The staccato qualities of the dialect are thought to originate either from Welsh or other European languages . The many local peculiarities have prompted The New York Times to describe Pittsburgh as `` the Galapagos Islands of American dialect '' . [ 206 ] The lexicon itself contains notable loans from Polish and other European languages ; examples include babushka , pierogi , and halušky .
