A Board comprised of seven members appointed by the Mayor and City Council presides over the work of the staff and determines all final dispositions of cases . The Board conducts public hearings and renders findings and recommendations to the Chief of Police and Mayor as related to the matter or complaint under review . Departmental/Bureau Overview Investigation and Complaint Disposition - Citizens must file a notice of intent to file a citizen complaint with the CPRB within six months of the incident from which the complaint arises . Upon contact from a citizen , the Intake Coordinator evaluates the complaint for administrative compliance and initiates the internal case management of the complaint .
