28 ] Originally , Cope wanted to sell rubber Jack Lambert masks , but realizing the high costs for the masks , opted for the inexpensive option for the Terrible Towel . The Terrible Towel has gained much popularity since its invention and `` is arguably the best-known fan symbol of any major pro sports team '' . [ 29 ] The catchphrase is : `` The Terrible Towel is poised to strike , and so are The Steelers . '' In 1996 , Cope gave the rights to The Terrible Towel to the Allegheny Valley School in Coraopolis , Pennsylvania . [ 14 ] The school provides care for more than 900 people [ 30 ] with intellectual disabilities and physical disabilities , including Cope 's son who has severe autism . [ 2 ] Proceeds from the Terrible Towel have helped raise $ 3 million for the school . [ 31 ] Retirement and death [ edit ] A special edition of `` The Terrible Towel '' was created in honor of Cope 's retirement following the 2005 Steelers ' season . Cope announced his retirement from broadcasting on June 20 , 2005 , citing health concerns . [ 32 ] Eight days later , it was announced that Cope was the recipient of the Pete Rozelle Award for `` long-time exceptional contributions to radio and television in professional football . '' [ 33 ] Upon his retirement , the Steelers did not replace Cope , opting instead to downsize to a two-man broadcast team . [ 13 ] On October 31 , 2005 , Cope was honored for his lifetime accomplishments at halftime of the contest between the Steelers and the Ravens . [ 34 ] In addition , the Steelers produced a special commemorative edition Terrible Towel with his familiar expressions printed on it . As seen on the towel , production was limited to 35,000 towels , representing 35 years of service to the Steelers . Later that season when the team advanced to Super Bowl XL , many Steelers fans wanted Cope to come out of retirement just to call `` The one for the thumb . '' Cope declined partially for health reasons and partially to enjoy retirement . [ citation needed ] A longtime heavy smoker , Cope died of respiratory failure at a Mt . Lebanon nursing home on the morning of February 27 , 2008 . [ 13 ] [ 35 ] In the days following his death , many ceremonies were held in his honor , including the local sporting events of the Pittsburgh Panthers college basketball team . [ 36 ] Two days after his death , hundreds of people gathered in heavy snow in front of the Pittsburgh City Hall to honor Cope ; included in the ceremony was one minute of silent Terrible Towel waving . [ 37 ] His funeral , which was held on February 29 , 2008 , was private . [ 38 ] Due to Cope 's large impact on the Pittsburgh area , Bob Smizik , a local sportswriter wrote , Had the secret of the service and its site not been kept , ... tens of thousands would have descended on the Slater funeral home in Green Tree . Such was the affection for Cope , ... that the parkway in both directions would have been clogged . Greentree and Cochran roads , the two main arteries leading to the funeral home , would have been parking lots .
