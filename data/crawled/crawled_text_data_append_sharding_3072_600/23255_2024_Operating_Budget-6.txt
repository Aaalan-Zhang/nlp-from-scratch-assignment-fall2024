The Mayor and City Controller are elected through a citywide vote . City Council ’ s nine representatives are elected to office by residents in each of their respective districts . The Office of the City Controller is responsible for auditing all City expenditures in order to prevent wasteful or fraudulent practices . Additionally , the City Controller reviews and approves contracts and is also charged with reporting to the citizens of Pittsburgh , the Mayor , and City Council the state of the City ’ s fiscal condition . Every year , the City Controller issues the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report , which provides detailed information on Pittsburgh ’ s short-term and long-term financial outlook . City Council proposes , deliberates , and votes on legislation governing and/or affecting the City . This body also approves appointments , regulates revenues and expenditures , and approves the final Operating and Capital Budgets . City Council is responsible for the introduction of legislation generated by the administrative branch of City government and may also introduce legislation from individual Council members to the body as a whole . City Council as a Body provides Council with centralized staff support under the direction of the City Clerk . The City Clerk , with the help of the Records Management Division , serves as a centralized document and information resource to Council , all City Departments , and the residents of the City of Pittsburgh . The City Council Budget Division monitors City finances and conducts independent analyses of City operations . It prepares and distributes to Council periodic reports on revenues , expenditures , and other trends relating to the fiscal condition of the City of Pittsburgh . It supervises and reviews City Council 's annual operating and capital budgets and compiles special reports and executive summaries to assist Members in their deliberations . The Office of the Mayor is the largest branch of the government of the City of Pittsburgh and is directly responsible for much of the City ’ s daily operations . This work is performed by individual Departments , Offices , Bureaus , and Commissions . The services provided by these entities range from public safety and public works to debt management . Many of these departments focus on specific services . For example , the Department of Law acts as a legal advisor to the Mayor , City Council , and other Departments . Two units act as umbrella organizations . The Department of Public Safety Bureau of Administration oversees the Bureaus of Police , Fire , Emergency Medical Services , and Animal Care and Control , as well as the Office of Community Health and Safety . Similarly , the Department of Public Works Bureau of Administration oversees the Bureaus of Operations , Environmental Services , and Facilities . Additionally , there are seven governmental units which fall within the Office of the Mayor in the City ’ s managerial hierarchy but whose sources of financing exist outside of the City ’ s General Fund .
