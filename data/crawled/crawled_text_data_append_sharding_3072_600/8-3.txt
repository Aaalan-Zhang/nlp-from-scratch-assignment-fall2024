The region 's counties also fall within the borders of Appalachia as defined by the Appalachian Regional Commission . [ 29 ] The City of Pittsburgh has been characterized as the `` northern urban industrial anchor of Appalachia '' [ 30 ] : which makes it an anomaly compared to much of Appalachia which has traditionally been characterized as southern , rural , and economically distressed . [ 30 ] Joseph Scarpaci , professor emeritus of geography at Virginia Tech , [ 31 ] has described Pittsburgh as having `` one foot in the East ... and the other in the Midwest '' . [ 30 ] Barbara Johnstone , professor of rhetoric and linguistics at Carnegie Mellon University , ascribes this isolation and idiosyncratic cultural identity of the region to the difficulty of moving through the Allegheny Mountains and the Allegheny Plateau . The Pittsburgh area was sort of isolated . It was very hard to get back and forth across the mountains . There 's always been a sense that Pittsburgh was kind of a place unto itselfâ€”not really southern , not really Midwestern , not really part of Pennsylvania . People just did n't move very much . [ 32 ] In his 2009 book , The Paris of Appalachia , Pittsburgh Post-Gazette writer Brian O'Neill meditates on this aspect of Pittsburgh 's regional and cultural ambiguity . The title of the book is intentionally provocative : `` The Paris of Appalachia '' some have called Pittsburgh derisively , because it 's still the largest city along this gorgeous mountain chain that needs a better press agent . I 've long felt we should embrace that title , though few are with me . Several tried to talk me out of slapping it on the cover , but were we called `` The Paris of the Rockies , '' we would n't run from it . Sometimes we 're so afraid of what others think , we 're afraid to say who we are . This city is not Midwestern . It 's not East Coast . It 's just Pittsburgh , and there 's no place like it . That 's both its blessing and its curse . [ 33 ] Arts [ edit ] Visual arts [ edit ] Greater Pittsburgh is home to several museums , galleries , and organizations which promote appreciation for the visual arts . The largest art museum in the region is the Carnegie Museum of Art , founded in 1895 by industrialist Andrew Carnegie and located in Pittsburgh 's Oakland neighborhood . It is renowned for its collections of 19th and 20th century decorative art , Japanese prints , and old master prints .
