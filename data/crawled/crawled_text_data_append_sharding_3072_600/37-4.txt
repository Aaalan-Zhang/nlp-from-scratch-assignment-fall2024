Although much of the structure and d√©cor remained the same , a new five-story wing was added to the back of the building . This wing expanded the stage and rehearsal space along with the music library and dressing rooms . [ 70 ] [ 71 ] Several concerts took place before the remodel and reopening of the Hall in 1971 , including a performance of works by Berlioz , Beethoven and Brahms by the Leonard Rose , Isaac Stern and Eugene Istomin Trio for the 1969 pension fund concert . Questionnaires filled out by symphony followers were collected after the concert and reflected an overwhelming support of the new venue . [ 72 ] Heinz Hall was dedicated in September 1971 . The inaugural concerts took place on September 10 and 11 with William Steinberg conducting Beethoven 's `` Consecration of the House '' overture and Mahler 's Symphony No . 2 ( `` Resurrection '' ) with a combined chorus of Pennsylvania State University choirs . The New York Times published an outstanding review of the performances , citing the improvement of the acoustics over previous Symphony venues saying , `` Pittsburghers at last have the opportunity to hear ( the orchestra ) as it ought to sound . '' [ 73 ] The Garden Plaza and a four-story addition to the Hall were completed in 1982 by the firm of MacLachlan , Cornelius & Filoni . The plaza included a waterfall and sculpture by London-based artist Angela Connor . The addition to the Hall included two bar/lounge spaces as well as a dining and meeting room . In addition , some public areas were refurbished into reception facilities in 1988 . [ 71 ] A $ 6.5-million renovation began in 1995 with funding provided by the Howard Heinz Endowment and Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Strategy 21 program funds . The renovation improved the acoustical , technical and aesthetic qualities of the Hall and was carried out by Architect Albert Filoni , of MacLachlan , Cornelius & Filoni , along with acoustician R. Lawrence Kirkegaard . The Hall reopened with a ribbon cutting ceremony by Governor Tom Ridge and Teresa Heinz .
