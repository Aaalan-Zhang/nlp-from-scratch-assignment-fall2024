son , Daniel , was born with severe autism ; he has lived most of his life at the Allegheny Valley School , an institution specializing in intellectual developmental disabilities . [ 14 ] Cope devoted much of his time and energy to Pittsburgh causes addressing autism , and spoke candidly about his experiences as the parent of a child with autism and his efforts to better educate the public at large about autism . [ 14 ] Steelers broadcasting [ edit ] Cope waves a Terrible Towel at Heinz Field – October 31 , 2005 In 1968 , Cope began doing daily sports commentaries on what was then WTAE-AM radio in Pittsburgh . [ 15 ] His unique nasal voice , with a distinctive Pittsburgh area accent , was noticed by the Steelers ' brass , and he made his debut as a member of the Steelers ' radio team in 1970 . [ 16 ] During Cope 's 35-year broadcasting career with the Steelers—the second longest term with a single team in NFL history , he was accompanied by only two play-by-play announcers : Jack Fleming , with whom he broadcast until 1994 , and Bill Hillgrove . [ 8 ] [ 13 ] In keeping with his comic personality , a series of television commentaries on WTAE-TV saw Cope calling himself `` Doctor Cope `` and wearing a white lab coat while pretending to examine the opposing team 's strengths and weaknesses . His predictor was known as the `` Cope-ra-scope . `` [ 17 ] In his last seven years , Cope would work alongside former Steelers offensive tackle Tunch Ilkin in the booth and help groom him for his own broadcasting career . Ilkin , upon his own retirement in 2021 due to complications from ALS ( which he would later die from on September 4 , 2021 ) , later joked that while he learned a lot from riding in the car with Cope for away games , Cope primarily rode with him because he allowed Cope to smoke cigarettes in the car . [ 18 ] Ilkin would eventually serve as a de facto replacement for Cope following Cope 's retirement . Catchphrases and nicknames [ edit ] Like other sports announcers in Pittsburgh , particularly Penguins commentator Mike Lange and the late Pirates announcer Bob Prince , Cope had a repertoire of unique catchphrases employed in his broadcasts , such as `` Mmm-Hah ! `` ( when he loses his train of thought , or forgets a player 's name ) and `` Okel Dokel `` ( his version of `` okey dokey `` ) . [ 8 ] Cope often used Yiddish expressions , especially `` Feh ! `` and `` Yoi ! `` ( sometimes multiplied as `` Double Yoi `` or rarely `` Triple Yoi `` ) . Cope also created nicknames for many players and opposing teams . It was Cope who popularized `` The Bus `` as a nickname for former Steelers running back Jerome Bettis , `` Jack Splat `` for Jack Lambert , and he gave Kordell Stewart the nickname `` Slash . `` [ 19 ] Cope also used the term `` Cincinnati Bungles `` to describe their division rivals , known during the 1990s for a string of bad seasons and numerous draft busts . [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] Myron also used terms such as `` Brownies , `` `` Birdies , `` `` Yonkos , `` `` Cryboys , `` and `` Redfaces `` for the football teams from Cleveland , Baltimore , Denver , Dallas , Washington , D.C. , in respective order . [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] Cope was noted for accusing future Hall of Famer Roberto Clemente of being `` baseball 's champion hypochondriac `` . [ 27 ] Terrible Towel [ edit ] Main article : Terrible Towel I said , what we need is something that everybody already has , so it does n't cost a dime . So I says , 'We 'll urge people to bring out to the game gold or black towels , ' then I 'll tell people if you do n't have a yellow , black or gold towel , buy one . And if you do n't want to buy one , dye one . We 'll call this the Terrible Towel . — Myron Cope on the invention of the Terrible Towel [ 28 ] Cope played a large role in the invention of the Terrible Towel . [ 29 ] Needing a way to excite the fans during a 1975 playoff game against the Baltimore Colts , Cope urged fans to take yellow dish towels to the game and wave them throughout . [ 28 ] Originally , Cope wanted to sell rubber Jack Lambert masks , but realizing the high costs for the masks , opted for the inexpensive option for the Terrible Towel . The Terrible Towel has gained much popularity since its invention and `` is arguably the best-known fan symbol of any major pro sports team `` . [ 29 ] The catchphrase is : `` The Terrible Towel is poised to strike , and so are The Steelers . `` In 1996 , Cope gave the rights to The Terrible Towel to the Allegheny Valley School in Coraopolis , Pennsylvania . [ 14 ] The school provides care for more than 900 people [ 30 ] with intellectual disabilities and physical disabilities , including Cope 's son who has severe autism . [ 2 ] Proceeds from the Terrible Towel have helped raise $ 3 million for the school . [ 31 ] Retirement and death [ edit ] A special edition of `` The Terrible Towel `` was created in honor of Cope 's retirement following the 2005 Steelers ' season . Cope announced his retirement from broadcasting on June 20 , 2005 , citing health concerns .
