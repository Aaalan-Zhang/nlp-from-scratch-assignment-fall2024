The city received a passing grade for ozone pollution , going from an F to a C grade , and improving from the 46th to 54th most polluted by ozone smog . [ 83 ] According to daily ozone air quality data provided by the EPA , from 2021 to 2024 , Pittsburgh had good or moderate air quality most of the time . [ 84 ] [ 85 ] Then-Allegheny County executive Rich Fitzgerald said in December 2023 that they ’ d seen an “ 80 % drop in hazardous air pollutants ” and that they made EPA attainment at all eight county air monitors for the first time in 2020 , and then also achieved that goal in 2021 , 2022 , and were on track for better results in 2023 . [ 86 ] A past 2019 `` State of the Air `` report from the American Lung Association ( ALA ) found that air quality in the Pittsburgh-New Castle-Weirton , PA-OH-WV metro area worsened compared to previous reports , not only for ozone ( smog ) , but also for the second year in a row for both the daily and long-term measures of fine particle pollution . In 2019 , outside of California , Allegheny County was the only county in the United States that recorded failing grades for all three . [ 87 ] In a 2013 ranking of 277 metropolitan areas in the United States , the American Lung Association ranked only six U.S. metro areas as having higher amounts of short-term particle pollution , and only seven U.S. metro areas having higher amounts of year-round particle pollution than Pittsburgh . For ozone ( smog ) pollution , Pittsburgh was ranked 24th among U.S. metro areas . [ 88 ] [ 89 ] The area has improved its air quality with every annual survey . The ALA 's rankings have been disputed by the Allegheny County Health Department ( ACHD ) , since data from only the worst of the region 's 20 air quality monitors is considered by the ALA , without any context or averaging . The lone monitor used is immediately downwind and adjacent to U.S. Steel 's Clairton Coke Works , the nation 's largest coke mill , and several municipalities outside the city 's jurisdiction of pollution controls , leading to possible confusion that Pittsburgh is the source or center of the emissions cited in the survey . [ 90 ] The region 's readings also reflect pollution swept in from Ohio and West Virginia . [ 91 ] Although the county was still below the `` pass `` threshold , the report showed substantial improvement over previous decades on every air quality measure . Fewer than 15 high ozone days were reported between 2007 and 2009 , and just 10 between 2008 and 2010 , compared to more than 40 between 1997 and 1999 . [ 92 ] ACHD spokesman Guillermo Cole stated `` It 's the best it 's been in the lifetime for virtually every resident in this county ... We 've seen a steady decrease in pollution levels over the past decade and certainly over the past 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 years , or more . `` [ 93 ] As of 2005 , the city includes 31,000 trees on 900 miles of streets . A 2011 analysis of Pittsburgh 's tree cover , which involved sampling more than 200 small plots throughout the city , showed a value of between $ 10 and $ 13 million in annual benefits based on the urban forest contributions to aesthetics , energy use and air quality . Energy savings from shade , impact on city air and water quality , and the boost in property values were taken into account in the analysis . The city spends $ 850,000 annually on street tree planting and maintenance . [ 94 ] Despite improvements , some studies still suggest that poor air quality in Pittsburgh is causing negative health effects . In a past study conducted between 2014 and 2016 researchers determined that children who lived in areas close to sources of pollution , such as industrial sites , experienced rates of asthma at almost 3 times the national average . [ 95 ] The study also found that 38 % of students live in areas over USEPA 's 12 micrograms per cubic meter standards , while 70 % live in areas over the WHO 's standard of 10 micrograms per cubic meter . [ 95 ] Several of the plants were located in or very near Pittsburgh . [ 95 ] The study also noted that most of the effected communities were minority communities . [ 95 ] This had led some residents in Pittsburgh to believe that the continuing effects of air pollution are a case of environmental racism .
