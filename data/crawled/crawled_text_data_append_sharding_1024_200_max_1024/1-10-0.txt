The multi-purpose Three Rivers Stadium was built in 1970 as part of the Renaissance I project . It was imploded in 2001 . Rich and productive , Pittsburgh was also the `` Smoky City , `` with smog sometimes so thick that streetlights burned during the day [ 11 ] as well as rivers that resembled open sewers . Civic leaders , notably Mayor David L. Lawrence , elected in 1945 , Richard K. Mellon , chairman of Mellon Bank and John P. Robin [ 71 ] [ 72 ] began smoke control and urban revitalization , also known as Urban Renewal projects that transformed the city [ 11 ] in unforeseen ways . `` Renaissance I `` began in 1946 . Title One of the Housing Act of 1949 provided the means in which to begin . By 1950 , vast swaths of buildings and land near the Point were demolished for Gateway Center . 1953 saw the opening of the ( since demolished ) Greater Pittsburgh Municipal Airport terminal . [ 27 ] In the late 1950s and early 1960s , the lower Hill District , an area inhabited predominantly by poor Blacks , was completely destroyed . Ninety-five acres of the lower Hill District were cleared using eminent domain , forcibly displacing hundreds of small businesses and more than 8,000 people ( 1,239 black families , 312 white ) , to make room for a cultural center that included the Civic Arena , which opened in 1961 . [ 73 ] Other than one apartment building , none of the other buildings planned for the cultural center were ever built . In the early 1960s , the neighborhood of East Liberty was also included in Renaissance I Urban Renewal plans , with over 125 acres ( 0.51 km 2 ) of the neighborhood being demolished and replaced with garden apartments , three 20-story public housing apartments , and a convoluted road-way system that circled a pedestrianized shopping district . In the span of just a few years during the mid-1960s , East Liberty became a blighted neighborhood . There were some 575 businesses in East Liberty in 1959 , but only 292 in 1970 , and just 98 in 1979 . Preservation efforts by the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation , along with community neighborhood groups , resisted the demolition plans . The neighborhoods containing rich architectural heritage , including the Mexican War Streets , Allegheny West , and Manchester , were spared . The center of Allegheny City , with its culturally and socially important buildings , was not as lucky . All of the buildings , with the exception of the Old U.S. Post Office , the Carnegie Library , and Buhl Planetarium were destroyed and replaced with the `` pedestrianized `` Allegheny Center Mall and apartments . The city 's industrial base continued to grow in the post-war era [ 74 ] partly assisted by the area 's first agency entirely devoted to industrial development , the RIDC . [ 75 ] [ 76 ] Jones and Laughlin Steel Company expanded its plant on the Southside . H.J . Heinz , Pittsburgh Plate Glass , Alcoa , Westinghouse , U.S. Steel and its new division , the Pittsburgh Chemical Company and many other companies also continued robust operations through the 1960s . [ 11 ] 1970 marked the completion of the final building projects of Renaissance I : the U.S. Steel Tower and Three Rivers Stadium . [ 27 ] In 1974 , with the addition of the fountain at the tip of the Golden Triangle , Point State Park was completed . [ 77 ] Although air quality was dramatically improved , and Pittsburgh 's manufacturing base seemed solid , questions abound about the negative effects Urban Renewal continues to have on the social fabric of Pittsburgh . Pittsburgh , however , was about to undergo one of its most dramatic transformations . Like most major cities , Pittsburgh experienced several days of rioting following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in April 1968 . There were no further major riots , although tension remained high in the inner-city black neighborhoods . [ 78 ] Reinvention ( 1973–present ) [ edit ] Downtown Pittsburgh in July 1974 A similar picture of Downtown Pittsburgh from Mt . Washington in December 2005 During the 1970s and 1980s , the U.S. steel industry came under increasing pressure from foreign competition and from American mini-mills constructed inexpensively using salvaged steel . [ citation needed ] Manufacture in Germany and Japan was booming . Foreign mills and factories , built with the latest technology , benefited from lower labor costs and powerful government-corporate partnerships , allowing them to capture increasing market shares of steel and steel products . Separately , demand for steel softened due to recessions , the 1973 oil crisis , and increasing use of other materials . [ 11 ] [ 79 ] The era began with the RIDC 's `` Building on Basics `` report in 1974 . [ 80 ] Collapse of steel [ edit ] Further information : Steel crisis Free market pressures exposed the U.S. steel industry 's own internal problems , which included a now-outdated manufacturing base that had been over-expanded in the 1950s and 1960s , hostile management and labor relationships , the inflexibility of United Steelworkers regarding wage cuts and work-rule reforms , oligarchic management styles , and poor strategic planning by both unions and management . In particular , Pittsburgh faced its own challenges . Local coke and iron ore deposits were depleted , raising material costs . The large mills in the Pittsburgh region also faced competition from newer , more profitable `` mini-mills `` and non-union mills with lower labor costs . [ 79 ] Beginning in the late 1970s and early 1980s , the steel industry in Pittsburgh began to implode along with the deindustrialization of the U.S. [ 81 ] Following the 1981–1982 recession , for example , the mills laid off 153,000 workers . [ 79 ] The steel mills began to shut down .
