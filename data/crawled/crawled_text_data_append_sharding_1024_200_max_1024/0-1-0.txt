Etymology [ edit ] Main article : Name of Pittsburgh Pittsburgh was named in 1758 , by General John Forbes , in honor of British statesman William Pitt , 1st Earl of Chatham . As Forbes was a Scotsman , he probably pronounced the name / ˈ p ɪ t s b ər ə / PITS -bər-ə ( similar to Edinburgh ) . [ 18 ] [ 19 ] Pittsburgh was incorporated as a borough on April 22 , 1794 , with the following Act : [ 20 ] `` Be it enacted by the Pennsylvania State Senate and Pennsylvania House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ... by the authority of the same , that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be ... erected into a borough , which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever . `` [ 21 ] From 1891 to 1911 , the city 's name was federally recognized as `` Pittsburg `` , though use of the final h was retained during this period by the city government and other local organizations . [ 22 ] [ 18 ] After a public campaign , the federal decision to drop the h was reversed . [ 18 ] The Pittsburg Press continued spelling the city without an h until 1921 .
