[ 155 ] Traditions [ edit ] Main article : Carnegie Mellon University traditions The Fence In the early days of Carnegie Tech , there was a single bridge connecting Margaret Morrison Women 's College with the Carnegie Institute of Technology . The bridge was a meeting place for students . In 1916 , the bridge was taken down and the university filled in the area . The administration built a wooden fence as a new meeting place . The students did not understand why anyone would want to meet at a fence . The administration was about to give up and tear it down , but that night a fraternity , as a prank , painted the entire fence advertising a fraternity party . Ever since , painting the Fence has been a Carnegie Mellon tradition . [ 156 ] The Fence at Carnegie Mellon lies at the center of campus , in the area known as `` the Cut `` . Students guard the fence 24 hours a day , and , as long as two vigils are maintained , no other student may `` take `` the fence . The fence can then be painted by the group that has it , but only between midnight and 6 am . Only hand brushes may be used ; the use of spray paint or paint rollers is considered vandalism and results in a fine . The previous paint can not be stripped , and each new painting adds a new layer . The original wooden fence finally collapsed in the 1990s due to the weight from over 1 ' of surrounding paint , and was immediately replaced with an identical one manufactured from concrete . Today the fence is considered `` the world 's most painted object `` by the Guinness Book of World Records .
