coast increased inland trade , so that goods flowed through Pittsburgh from all four directions . By 1815 , Pittsburgh was producing $ 764K in iron ; $ 249K in brass and tin , and $ 235K in glass products . [ 11 ] When , on March 18 , 1816 , Pittsburgh was incorporated as a city , it had already taken on some of its defining characteristics : commerce , manufacture , and a constant cloud of coal dust . [ 32 ] Other emerging towns challenged Pittsburgh . In 1818 , the first segment of the National Road was completed , from Baltimore to Wheeling , bypassing Pittsburgh . This threatened to render the town less essential in east–west commerce . In the coming decade , however , many improvements were made to the transportation infrastructure . In 1818 , the region 's first river bridge , the Smithfield Street Bridge , opened , the first step in developing the `` City of bridges `` over its two rivers . [ citation needed ] On October 1 , 1840 , the original Pennsylvania Turnpike was completed , connecting Pittsburgh and the eastern port city of Philadelphia . In 1834 , the Pennsylvania Main Line Canal was completed , making Pittsburgh part of a transportation system that included rivers , roads , and canals . [ 27 ] Manufacture continued to grow . In 1835 , McClurg , Wade and Co. built the first locomotive west of the Alleghenies . Already , Pittsburgh was capable of manufacturing the most essential machines of its age . By the 1840s , Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the mountains . In 1841 , the Second Court House , on Grant 's Hill , was completed . Made from polished gray sandstone , the court house had a rotunda 60 feet ( 18 m ) in diameter and 80 feet ( 24 m ) high . [ 33 ] Great Fire of Pittsburgh , 1845 Like many burgeoning cities of its day , Pittsburgh 's growth outstripped some of its necessary infrastructure , such as a water supply with dependable pressure . [ 34 ] Because of this , on April 10 , 1845 , a great fire burned out of control , destroying over a thousand buildings and causing $ 9M in damages . [ 31 ] As the city rebuilt , the age of rails arrived . In 1851 , the Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad began service between Cleveland and Allegheny City ( present-day North Side ) . [ 27 ] In 1854 , the Pennsylvania Railroad began service between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia . Despite many challenges , Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial powerhouse . An 1857 article provided a snapshot of the Iron City : [ 31 ] 939 factories in Pittsburgh and Allegheny City employing more than 10K workers producing almost $ 12M in goods using 400 steam engines Total coal consumed — 22M bushels Total iron consumed — 127K tons In steam tonnage , third busiest port in the nation , surpassed only by New York City and New Orleans .

Scots Irish leadership [ edit ] Ingham ( 1978 ) examined the leadership of the industry in its most important center , Pittsburgh , as well as smaller cities . He concludes that the leadership of the iron and steel industry nationwide was `` largely Scotch Irish `` . Ingham finds that the Scotch Irish held together cohesively throughout the 19th century and `` developed their own sense of uniqueness . `` [ 36 ] New immigrants after 1800 made Pittsburgh a major Scotch-Irish stronghold . For example , Thomas Mellon ( b. Ulster 1813–1908 ) left northern Ireland in 1823 for the United States . He founded the powerful Mellon family , which played a central role in banking and industries such as aluminum and oil . As Barnhisel ( 2005 ) finds , industrialists such as James Laughlin ( b. Ulster 1806–1882 ) of Jones and Laughlin Steel Company comprised the `` Scots-Irish Presbyterian ruling stratum of Pittsburgh society . `` [ 37 ] Technology [ edit ] In 1859 , the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced coke -fire smelting to the region . The American Civil War boosted the city 's economy with increased production of iron and armaments , especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry . [ 33 ] Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world 's first 21 `` gun . [ 38 ] By war 's end , over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh . A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875 , when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process . [ 39 ] Industrialists such as Andrew Carnegie , Henry Clay Frick , Andrew W. Mellon , and Charles M. Schwab built their fortunes in Pittsburgh . Also based in Pittsburgh was George Westinghouse , credited with such advancements as the air brake and founder of over 60 companies , including Westinghouse Air and Brake Company ( 1869 ) , Union Switch & Signal ( 1881 ) , and Westinghouse Electric Company ( 1886 ) . [ 40 ] Banks played a key role in Pittsburgh 's development as these industrialists sought massive loans to upgrade plants , integrate industries and fund technological advances . For example , T. Mellon & Sons Bank , founded in 1869 , helped to finance an aluminum reduction company that became Alcoa .
