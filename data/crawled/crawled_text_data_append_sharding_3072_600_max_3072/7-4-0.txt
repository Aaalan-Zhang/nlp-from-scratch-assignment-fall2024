[ 59 ] 2009 G-20 Pittsburgh Summit [ edit ] Main article : 2009 G-20 Pittsburgh summit Pittsburgh was chosen to hold the 2009 G-20 summit for multiple reasons . Pittsburgh utilizes its past by building on previous successes in manufacturing , business services , and green energy . `` Pittsburgh manufacturers employ almost 100,000 workers and the region is the second-largest market in the United States for metals industry employment . `` [ 60 ] Pittsburgh is also home to some of the world 's largest business and financial services , which supply the greatest amount to the regional economic output . In the past , innovation in energy has been advanced through commercialization of oil , coal , and natural gas . More focus and attention is being given to the innovation in sustainability and efficiency while protecting the environment as Pittsburgh has more than 30 LEED certified buildings . [ 60 ] Economic development plan [ edit ] The State of Pennsylvania requires every county to develop a land use and growth management plan . Allegheny Places is the plan for Pittsburgh and Allegheny County . It was adopted in November 2008 and is a “ unique blueprint for a sustainable future envisioned by the citizens of the County ” . [ 61 ] The plan has a steering committee with over 100 members , an advisory committee with over 400 members , and a sounding board . The plan advocates a future in which : Equitable access to the opportunities and benefits of economic development to all residents is provided Former brownfields are transformed and developed Transit-oriented development efforts reduce road congestion and connect the major economic areas – Oakland , Downtown , and the Pittsburgh International Airport The promotion of greenways will link the community with parks , trails , riverfronts , etc . Affordable [ clarification needed ] and high-quality [ clarification needed ] housing exists for all A diversified economy provides stable , well-paying jobs [ 62 ] The economic development plan includes enterprise zones , research and technology developments , development of research parks , such as the University of Pittsburgh Applied Research Center , partnerships with economic development organizations , and venture capital initiatives . An Urban Enterprise Zone is a location within the inner city free from import duties , taxes , and some government regulations . [ 63 ] Studies of enterprise zones have shown increased job growth and investment . In the majority of studies , there is an apparent relationship between the creation of enterprise zones and increased economic activity in the zones . The zones also show economic activity not typical of the surrounding metropolitan area . [ 64 ] However , success is often questionable and subject to local conditions . [ 65 ] Allegheny County has 26 enterprise zones , in which 17 are in the City of Pittsburgh . [ 62 ] The research and technology sector is growing due to the local universities , medical centers , the technology cluster , and the provision of financial capital to fund its development . These attributes provide the specific infrastructure required of sought-after industries . [ 62 ] Therefore , this could attract business to the region and sustain or expand existing firms , which should result in a net increase in total jobs . However , this type of development is still fairly new , which means it is difficult to draw any noteworthy conclusions about its potential . Also , the presence of universities provides the context for university-industry technology transfers , which is the effective movement of technology to industry via students trained in detailed programs to meet the detailed wants of the industry . [ 66 ] Economic upward mobility [ edit ] According to a 2014 report published by the National Bureau of Economic Research , Pittsburgh is the second-best American city for intergenerational economic mobility ; [ 67 ] in other words , Pittsburgh is the second best city to achieve the American Dream .

After the layoff , the company will still have approximately 800 employees in the Pittsburgh area . [ 73 ] 2014 news [ edit ] Work is underway for an innovation roadmap for the city .
