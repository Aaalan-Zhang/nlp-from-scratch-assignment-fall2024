Departmental/Bureau Overview The Office of Community Health and Safety is focused on building a response continuum and developing sustainable upstream interventions to address unmet community social service needs that often fall to Public Safety personnel , who represent the 24/7 safety net response . Through partnerships and program development , the Office will focus on : Developing a Continuum of Support : Through continued collaboration with first responders and community members , analysis of calls for service , mapping of existing services , development of new partnerships , and evaluation of existing models , the Office of Community Health & Safety ( OCH & S ) will establish a continuum of resources and responders to address community unmet social service needs that are often encountered by Public Safety partners . First responder social support referrals , case conferencing and review , and service gap analysis will be utilized to build this continuum . Implementation of Public Health-Informed Practices : Public Safety personnel consistently respond to community needs that exceed what they can provide in a single engagement model ; however , first responders have significant exposure to issues that affect community members ’ health and well-being . OCH & S will work with the Department of Public Safety , public health entities , and academic partners to evaluate new programs and responses to proactively address issues ( especially upstream interventions ) and reduce harm experienced by community members . Additionally , partners will evaluate best practices , facilitate focus groups , and elevate translational experiences . Consistent Community Engagement and Partnership : Continued community engagement , transparency , and accountability to the community and first responders is critical to building trust and facilitating change in the current response continuum . OCH & S will create a collaborative model of program development and evaluation , prioritizing continuous review to ensure that deficits are quickly addressed and used for growth . OCH & S will partner with existing community organizations and prioritize community members who have been harmed and may not engage in traditional meetings . Initial efforts will focus on creation of multiple advisory collaboratives focused on Black neighborhoods most harmed by the war on drugs and systemic racism . Note : The Office of Community Health full time positions can be found in the Stop the Violence trust fund .
