in the sport . [ 14 ] The franchise won the World Series three more times— in 1960 , 1971 , and 1979 . In 1960 , the team became the first to win a World Series on a walk-off home run , hit by Bill Mazeroski , and they remain the only team to win on a walk-off homer in the decisive seventh game . In 1979 , the Pirates repeated the accomplishment of their own 1925 World Series team , coming back from a three-games-to-one deficit , winning three games in a row when facing elimination , for the title . Thus the Pirates became ( and they currently remain ) the only franchise in the history of all sports to win world titles more than once when coming back from a 3-1 deficit . The 1979 Pirates also are unique in that they are the only team in all sports to have players who captured all four MVP awards : Seasonal ( Willie Stargell , co-MVP with Keith Hernandez ) , All Star Game ( Dave Parker ) , NLCS ( Willie Stargell ) , and World Series ( Willie Stargell ) within a single season . [ 15 ] Since 1970 the team has won their division and qualified for the playoffs nine times : six in the 1970s , and three times in a row from 1990 to 1992 . Pirate players have won the league MVP award in 1960 ( Dick Groat ) , 1966 ( Roberto Clemente ) , 1978 ( Dave Parker ) , 1979 ( Willie Stargell ) , 1990 ( Barry Bonds ) , 1992 ( Barry Bonds ) , and 2013 ( Andrew McCutchen ) and the Cy Young Award in 1960 ( Vernon Law ) and 1990 ( Doug Drabek ) . In 2001 , the team opened PNC Park on the city 's North Shore , regularly ranked as one of the top three baseball parks in the country . In addition to the Pirates , the Pittsburgh Stogies , Pittsburgh Burghers and Pittsburgh Rebels played in various leagues from 1884 to 1915 . The Rebels won the pennant in 1912 and finished just a half game shy of a pennant in 1915 . [ 16 ] The Pittsburgh Keystones , Homestead Grays ( playing in the city limits ) , and Pittsburgh Crawfords played in the Negro leagues . With players including Josh Gibson and Cumberland Posey the Grays won 12 league titles—the most by any Negro league team [ 1 ] —including nine consecutive from 1937 to 1945 . The Crawfords finished their eight-year existence with a .633 winning percentage , with a line-up including Gibson , Cool Papa Bell , and Satchel Paige and claimed four straight league titles from 1933 until 1936 , with the 1935 team judged by some [ who ? ] as the greatest one to ever take the field in the Negro leagues , or perhaps in baseball period . Just as they initially played in the first `` modern `` ballpark in the majors ( Forbes Field ) , Crawfords owner Gus Greenlee constructed the first steel and concrete `` modern `` stadium in the Negro leagues , with Greenlee Field opening in the Hill District on April 29 , 1932 . [ 17 ] Basketball [ edit ] Pittsburgh South Side won Western Pennsylvania Basketball League and Central Basketball League titles in 1904 , 1907 and 1913 , coming in second place in 1908 , 1911 and 1915 . The `` Black Fives `` league enjoyed success in the city with Monticello-Loendi winning national championships in 1912 , and four in a row from 1920–23 . The Pittsburgh Pirates from 1937–39 and Pittsburgh Raiders in 1944–45 continued professional basketball in the city in the National Basketball League . Pittsburgh had one of the founding members of what became the NBA , the Pittsburgh Ironmen however only played a single season 1947–48 before folding . The Pittsburgh Renaissance ( or Rens ) played from 1961 until 1963 in the ABL , posting the city 's best record in almost 40 years when they finished 2nd in 1962 . The most lasting legacy of pro roundball in Pittsburgh was the Pittsburgh Pipers-Pittsburgh Condors of the American Basketball Association from 1967 until 1972 . In the first ABA World Championship in 1968 , the Pipers defeated the New Orleans Buccaneers , which were owned by Harry Connick Sr. [ citation needed ] After the ABA Pipers/Condors folded in 1972 the city hosted the Pittsburgh Piranhas of the CBA in the mid-1990s . The franchise made it to the championship round in the 1994–95 season . Taking the series into the 6th game the Piranhas lost by a basket in the final seconds ( 92-94 ) by what they claimed was an ineligible player , the CBA denied a replay game in what would have been Pittsburgh 's second pro-basketball world title . [ 1 ] In the late 2000s the Pittsburgh Xplosion , a development league team owned by former NBA player Freddie Lewis , [ 18 ] played in a revamped ABA/CBA at Mellon Arena and the Petersen Events Center before ceasing operations prior to the 2008–09 season because of the economic recession . Another professional basketball team , the Pittsburgh Phantoms of the American Basketball Association , played during the 2009–10 season and held their games at the Carnegie Library of Homestead , but folded prior to the following season . Hockey [ edit ] See also : Flyers–Penguins rivalry and Sports in Philadelphia § Pittsburgh First played in Pittsburgh in 1895 , ice hockey grew in popularity after the Duquesne Gardens opened in 1899 . In 1901 the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League ( WPHL ) , a semi-professional ice hockey league based in Pittsburgh in the early 1900s , may have been involved in the first trade involving professional hockey players . In 1907 , the WPHL was the first league to openly hire hockey players .
