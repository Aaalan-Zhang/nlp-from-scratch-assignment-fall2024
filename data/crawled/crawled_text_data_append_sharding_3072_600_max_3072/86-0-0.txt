Aimed at an international audience—and indeed , it was the first Mexican film to be nominated for an Academy Award , as well as Mexico ’ s entry in the 1960 Cannes Film Festival—Macario takes the form of a macabre fable about an impoverished peasant ( Ignacio López Tarso ) who dreams of having enough food to satisfy his constant hunger . Macario ’ s life takes a dramatic turn when he encounters three mysterious figures representing Death ( played by José Gálvez ) , the Devil ( played by Enrique Lucero ) , and God ( played by Pina Pellicer ) . They offer him a gift : a magical turkey that will grant him three wishes . In exchange , Macario must promise to give the bones of the turkey to Death . P With his newfound ability to fulfill his desires , Macario embarks on a journey filled with moral dilemmas and consequences . He uses his wishes to satisfy his hunger and improve his social status but soon realizes that wealth and power do not bring him true happiness . As he grapples with the consequences of his choices , Macario learns profound lessons about greed , compassion , and the nature of human existence .
