His successor , Bill Peduto , was sworn in on January 6 , 2014 . In November 2021 , Pittsburgh elected its first African-American mayor , Ed Gainey . Prior to the American Civil War , Pittsburgh was strongly abolitionist . It is considered the birthplace of the national Republican Party , [ 241 ] as the party held its first convention here in February 1856 . From the Civil War to the 1930s , Pittsburgh was a Republican stronghold . The effects of the Great Depression , combined with entrenched local GOP scandals , resulted in a shift among voters to the Democratic Party . With the exceptions of the 1973 and 1977 elections ( where lifelong Democrats ran off the party ticket ) , Democrats have been elected consecutively to the mayor 's office since the 1933 election . The city 's ratio of party registration is 5 to 1 Democrat . [ 242 ] Pittsburgh is represented in the Pennsylvania General Assembly by three Senate Districts ( Lindsey Williams ( D ) - 38 , Wayne D. Fontana ( D ) -42 , and Jay Costa ( D ) -43 ) and nine House Districts ( Aerion Abney -19 , Adam Ravenstahl-20 , Sara Innamorato -21 , Dan Frankel -23 , Martell Covington-24 , Dan Deasy-27 , Abigail Salisbury -34 , and Harry Readshaw-36 , Dan Miller-42 ) . Federally , Pittsburgh is part of Pennsylvania 's 12th congressional district , represented by Democrat Summer Lee since 2023 and also by Democrat Chris Deluzio . Law enforcement [ edit ] A Ford Taurus and a Chevrolet Impala belonging to the Pittsburgh Police The area 's largest law enforcement agency is the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police , with close to 850 sworn officers . The city also has separate housing and school police departments . Other agencies also provide police protection within the city because of overlapping jurisdictional boundaries . The Allegheny County Sheriff focuses on jail and courthouse security . The Allegheny County Police primarily patrols county-owned parks and airports , while providing detective/investigatory functions for smaller suburbs and the Port Authority police patrols rapid transit . Pennsylvania State Police Troop B provides patrols for the city and immediate suburbs . The county 's lead law enforcement officer is Allegheny County District Attorney Stephen Zappala while the Allegheny County Medical Examiner heads forensics . Crimes of a federal nature are covered by the U.S. Attorney for Western Pennsylvania . Crime [ edit ] Pittsburgh annually ranks as one of America 's safest big cities , in 2013 being named the 3rd `` most secure `` big city by Farmers Insurance . [ 243 ] Among crime rates of the 60 largest U.S. cities , 43 had more instances of property crime while 16 had less when compared to Pittsburgh . More instances of violent crime were reported in 21 of the largest cities while 37 had less . The FBI recommends against using data for ranking . [ 244 ] [ 245 ] Per 100,000 persons stats ( 2012 ) : Murder Rape Robbery Assault Burglary Theft Motor vehicle Total violent Total property City 13.1 15.1 363.3 360.4 812.8 2,438.2 174.3 752.0 3,425.4 At the end of 2019 , the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police reported 37 murders in the city that year . [ 246 ] In Pittsburgh , the homicide rate for African Americans is seven times the national average . [ 247 ] Some people believe that over-reliance on law enforcement exacerbates homicide rates . [ 247 ] There is also concern regarding the effectiveness of law enforcement in solving these cases , as 97 % of unsolved cases involved a black victim . [ 248 ] This has led certain residents to believe law enforcement to be ineffective or apathetic . [ 248 ] This is despite an increasing police budget . In 2023 , members of the Pittsburgh City Council approved an increase to the police budget by $ 6 million . [ 249 ] About 6 % of this money is expected to go to the Stop the Violence trust fund . This fund goes to improving parks and recreation , various non-profits , and to the office of Community Health and Safety , in effort to holistically improve the social pressures supposedly causing violence in Pittsburgh . [ 250 ] Some people do not believe these efforts to be adequate . Certain studies , such as conducted by the Police Scorecard , rate the Pittsburgh Police Department at 37 % quality ( with 100 % being the best ) . They rated Pittsburgh below the 50th percentile in the categories “ police budget cost per person , ” “ fines / forefeitures , ” “ Police Presence/Over-Policing ( Officers per Population ) , ” “ Force Used per Arrest , ” “ Racial Disparities in Deadly Force , ” “ Excessive Force Complaints Upheld , ” “ Discrimination Complaints Upheld , ” “ Criminal Misconduct Complaints Upheld , ” “ Arrest Rate for Low Level Offenses , ” and “ Racial Disparities in Drug Arrests . ” This is 10 out of 15 categories .
