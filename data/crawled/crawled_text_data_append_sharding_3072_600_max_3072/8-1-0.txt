be divided into 'mega regions ' based on the most extreme commuting patterns within a geographical area ( commutes within 100 miles from the core city ) . By this liberal definition , the Pittsburgh mega region consists of twenty-eight Pennsylvania counties ( Allegheny , Armstrong , Beaver , Bedford , Blair , Butler , Cambria , Cameron , Centre , Clarion , Clearfield , Crawford , Elk , Erie , Fayette , Forest , Greene , Huntingdon , Indiana , Jefferson , Lawrence , Mercer , Mifflin , Somerset , Venango , Warren , Washington , and Westmoreland ) , nineteen West Virginia counties ( Barbour , Brooke , Doddridge , Grant , Hancock , Harrison , Lewis , Marion , Marshall , Mineral , Monongalia , Ohio , Preston , Randolph , Taylor , Tucker , Tyler , Upshur , and Wetzel ) , five Ohio counties ( Belmont , Columbiana , Harrison , Jefferson , and Monroe ) , and two Maryland counties ( Allegany and Garrett ) , and portions of Chautauqua , New York in and around Ripley . [ 11 ] The combined population of the megaregion was over 4.9 million in 2016 . [ 13 ] Border of Pittsburgh Megaregion showing included counties [ 14 ] There are also several formal definitions of Greater Pittsburgh which are often used in media mentions of the region . These include the Office of Management and Budget 's Pittsburgh , PA Metropolitan Statistical Area ( MSA ) and Pittsburgh-New Castle-Weirton , PA-OH-WV Combined Statistical Area ( CSA ) . [ 15 ] The Nielsen Corporation 's Pittsburgh Designated Market Area ( DMA ) is another commonly used formal definition of the region . [ 16 ] There are nineteen counties included in at least one of these definitions and their combined population was over 2.9 million in 2016 .

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] Pittsburgh 's association with the Great Lakes region is due in part to its economic , demographic and commuter connections to Great Lakes cities like Cleveland , Erie , Toledo and even Detroit . [ 20 ] Christopher Briem , an economist at the University of Pittsburgh 's University Center for Social and Urban Research , has argued that southwestern Pennsylvania is `` far more interconnected `` with northeastern Ohio than it is with the eastern half of Pennsylvania , and that the industries of Pittsburgh are primarily linked to Ohioan cities such as Youngstown , Akron , and Cleveland , not to Pennsylvanian cities such as Allentown , Scranton , or Philadelphia . [ 21 ] He notes that , conversely , the population centers of northeastern Ohio are primarily connected with Pittsburgh and only secondarily connected to the state capital of Columbus . Briem argues that `` In so many ways the state boundaries we think of as important are no more than lines on a map . `` [ 21 ] In recognizing their economic interdependence , Briem coined the term `` Cleveburgh `` to refer collectively to the cities of Cleveland and Pittsburgh , along with the smaller towns dotting the corridor of I-76 between the cities . [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] Robert Lang and Arthur Nelson of the Metropolitan Institute at Virginia Tech also identify the region between Cleveland and Pittsburgh as being an interconnected `` megapolitan area `` and refer to it as the `` Steel Corridor `` .
