View this post on Instagram A post shared by DLTSGDOM ! Collective ( @ dltsgdomshows ) Brillobox Way back in 2005 , before people had even invented the word `` hipster , `` Brillobox established itself as the coolest bar for those wanting an elevated night out experience minus the pretension . Situated on Main . St right before Bloomfield turns in Lawrenceville , this venue promises a unique ambiance you wo n't find replicated anywhere else in the city and the bar menu to back up what all the hype is about . Head upstairs to their music venue for a variety of bands I am now far too old to know anything about and all seem way cooler than I 'll ever be . Pro Tip : For the Millennials among us , MySpace Nite ( held monthly ) is the best dance party in the city . Photo Credit : @ ortizonkeyz2601 on Insta Cattivo Head down the hill from Brillobox and into Lawrenceville to Cattivo , yet another alt-friendly dive venue that has been bringing live music to the city for decades . Head to their Obscure parties monthly that encourage you to let you freak flag fly as a variety of DJs play everything EDM from classic to modern genres . Their stage holds a variety of bands weekly , but especially focuses on the gothic , industrial and dark alt scenes . Pro Tip : Skip their website and Insta . Find all of their upcoming events on Facebook . Government Center Perhaps best known for their huge selection of vinyl , this record shop also manages to pack in a nice crowd with national musicians from noise rank to folk country to enjoy as you browse the wax . These owners live and breathe music , so I encourage you to explore every inch of this store and ask questions ; you never know what you 're going to uncover here . Pro Tip : This is secretly my favorite coffee shop in Pittsburgh . Even if you 're not into music , try it out when you 're in the Northside . Concerts among stacks of wax ? Let 's go Bottlerocket Social Hall Imagine you could transport right to a 70s bar in an iconic Pittsburgh neighborhood without needing time travel . You 're in luck because Bottlerocket has all the wood paneling you 'll ever need , and it 's all original from the bones of the Allentown bar it was made from . What their owners have added to this time capsule of a bar is incredible live comedy , movie screenings and , most importantly for this blog , a kickin ' music venue for everything alt and even vinyl release parties . Pro Tip : If you go to a seated show , you can order your beer right from a QR code and have it brought directly to your seat so you never miss a minute . Can every venue start doing this ? ? Tequila Cowboy Country fans , we have live music venues for you , too ! Saddle up and head to Tequila Cowboy on most Thursdays , Fridays and Saturdays for a rotating mix of featured country artists from the Burgh and beyond . While this place plays both types of music ( country and western ) wander back to the karaoke bar and sing to your heart 's content at this go-to party place . Photo Credit : @ briannablankenshipmusic on Insta Moondog 's As old school as it gets , Moondog 's has been cranking up the volume for decades in Blawnox , with fantastic acoustics supporting the best blues and rock groups in the Burgh . Pro Tip : Even if you 're just stopping in for a drink , the wall of guitars behind the bar and dog-musician mural on the opposite side are worth a visit alone . This Is Red In Pittsburgh , we love churches-turned-music venues . At This is Red , St. Michael 's Slovakian Roman Catholic has been resurrected into the event space and concert venue .
