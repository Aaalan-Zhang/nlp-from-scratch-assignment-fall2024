Burning the paintings would destroy the evidence of her son ’ s crime , but one of the paintings—Lucien Freud ’ s “ Woman With Eyes Closed ” —looks just like her own mother , a painter who died when Mona was still young . The uncanny resemblance unlocks long-buried memories that fuel the fires of three different possible endings . This world premiere opera from award-winning composer Jennifer Higdon ( Cold Mountain ) is inspired by a real-life art heist , and confronts the question “ what is the true value of a work of art ? ” This is an opera that needs to be seen at least twice ; each night of the production has the possibility of a completely new ending ! Commissioned by Opera Philadelphia . Funded in part by The Amphion Foundation , Inc .
