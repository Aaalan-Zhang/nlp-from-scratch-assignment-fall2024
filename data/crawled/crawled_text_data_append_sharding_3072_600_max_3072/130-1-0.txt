, the museum also hosts many exhibits by contemporary artists . [ 9 ] Carnegie Museum of Art [ edit ] Main article : Carnegie Museum of Art Carnegie Museum of Art 's Sarah Scaife Gallery annex . Designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes and Associates . [ 10 ] When Andrew Carnegie envisioned a museum collection consisting of the `` Old Masters of tomorrow , `` the Carnegie Museum of Art arguably became the first museum of modern art in the United States . The museum was founded as the Department of Fine Arts , Carnegie Institute in 1895 . The name was changed to its current name in [ 11 ] 1986 . Today the museum continues showcasing contemporary art by staging the Carnegie International exhibition every three to five years . Numerous works from the International exhibitions have been acquired for the museums ' permanent collection including Winslow Homer 's The Wreck ( 1896 ) and James A. McNeill Whistler 's Arrangement in Black : Portrait of Señor Pablo de Sarasate ( 1884 ) . [ 12 ] [ 13 ] The Hall of Sculpture , constructed in white marble , replicates the interior of the Parthenon . [ 14 ] The Hall of Architecture contains the largest collection of plaster casts of architectural masterpieces in America and one of the three largest in the world . Opened in 1974 , the Sarah Scaife Galleries Annex was designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes and Associates . The Sarah Scaife Foundation gift nearly doubled the exhibition square footage . The modernist addition was designed to not compete with the existing building . Trustee James L. Winokur says of architect Edward Larrabee Barnes , `` He kept the old building out front . He was not terribly concerned about getting credit , just concerned about doing the job right , and he did do it right . `` [ 10 ] The Heinz Architectural Center , opened as part of the museum in 1993 , is dedicated to the collection , study , and exhibition of architectural drawings , prints and models . [ 11 ] Most of these are from the 19th and 20th centuries . In 2001 the museum acquired the archive of African-American photographer Charles `` Teenie `` Harris , consisting of approximately 80,000 photographic negatives spanning from the 1930s to the 1970s . Many of these images have been cataloged and digitized . The museum 's permanent collection includes European and American decorative arts from the late seventeenth century to the present , works on paper , paintings , prints ( most notably Japanese prints ) , sculptures and installations . [ 11 ] Carnegie Museum of Natural History [ edit ] Carnegie Museum of Natural History Main article : Carnegie Museum of Natural History Opened alongside the Carnegie Museum of Art in 1895 , the Carnegie Museum of Natural History is currently home to over twenty million objects and artifacts . Carnegie oversaw the collecting from 1895 to 1907 and it reflected his ideas of evolutionary development . [ 4 ] [ 15 ] Most notably , it houses a collection of 230 dinosaur fossils—including the most complete Tyrannosaurus rex known to date—as well as exhibits such as Hillman Hall of Minerals and Gems , Alcoa Foundation Hall of American Indians , and Walton Hall of Ancient Egypt . The museum 's Powdermill Nature Reserve was established in 1956 to serve as a field station for long-term studies of natural populations , and now forms the core of the museum 's Center for Biodiversity and Ecosystems . Research teams that included Carnegie scientists have made discoveries such as Puijila darwini and Hadrocodium wui . [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Kamin Science Center [ edit ] Carnegie Science Center Main article : Kamin Science Center Opened in 1991 , but with a history that dates to October 24 , 1939 , the Kamin Science Center is the most visited museum in Pittsburgh . [ 9 ] The Kamin Science Center houses the Buhl Planetarium & Observatory , the Rangos Giant Cinema Theater , and a number of temporary and permanent exhibits , including Highmark SportsWorks , the Miniature Railroad & Village , and the Robot Hall of Fame . [ 9 ] On February 21 , 1990 , Pennsylvania Senator John Heinz introduced Senate Bill S. 2151 , which allowed the USS Requin , a World War II submarine , to be transferred as an exhibit for the science center . The purpose of the exhibit is for visitors to learn how people lived and worked on the boat . The Buhl Planetarium and larger Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh merged in 1987 , leading to an October 1989 groundbreaking on the newly-named Carnegie Science Center building . A large donation by the Kamin family led to the science center 's renaming in 2024 . [ 18 ] References [ edit ] ^ a b `` National Register Information System `` .
