% ages 65 or older . By the 2019 American Community Survey , the median income for a household increased to $ 53,799 . [ 134 ] Families had a median income of $ 68,922 ; married-couple families had a median income of $ 93,500 ; and non-family households had a median income of $ 34,448 . Pittsburgh 's wealthiest suburbs within city limits are Squirrel Hill and Point Breeze , the only two areas of the city which have average household incomes over $ 100,000 a year . Outside of city limits , Sewickley Heights is by a wide margin the wealthiest suburb of Pittsburgh within Allegheny County , with an average yearly household income of just over $ 218,000 . Sewickely Heights is seen as one of Pittsburgh 's wealthiest suburbs culturally as well , titles which the suburbs of Upper St. Clair , Fox Chapel , Wexford , and Warrendale also have been bestowed . [ 135 ] [ 136 ] In a 2002 study , Pittsburgh ranked 22nd of 69 urban places in the U.S. in the number of residents 25 years or older who had completed a bachelor 's degree , at 31 % . [ 137 ] Pittsburgh ranked 15th of the 69 places in the number of residents 25 years or older who completed a high school degree , at 84.7 % . [ 138 ] The metro area has shown greater residential racial integration during the last 30 years . The 2010 census ranked 18 other U.S. metros as having greater black-white segregation , while 32 other U.S. metros rank higher for black-white isolation . [ 139 ] As of 2018 , much of Pittsburgh 's population density was concentrated in the central , southern , and eastern areas . The city limits itself have a population density of 5,513 people per square mile ; its most densely populated parts are North Oakland ( at 21,200 per square mile ) and Uptown Pittsburgh ( at 19,869 per square mile ) . Outside of the city limits , Dormont and Mount Oliver are Pittsburgh 's most densely-populated neighborhoods , with 11,167 and 9,902 people per square mile respectively . [ 140 ] Most of Pittsburgh 's immigrants are from China , India , Korea and Italy . [ 141 ] Demographic changes [ edit ] Since the 1940s , some demographic changes have sometimes been caused by city initiatives for redevelopment . Throughout the 1950s Pittsburgh 's Lower Hill District faced massive demographic changes when 1,551 , majority black , residents and 413 businesses were forced to relocate when the city of Pittsburgh used eminent domain to make space for the construction of the Civic Arena . [ 13 ] This Civic Arena ultimately opened in 1961 . [ 13 ] The Civic Arena was built as part of one of Pittsburgh 's revitalization campaigns . An auditorium in this space was initially proposed in 1947 by the Regional Planning Association and Urban Redevelopment Authority . The idea of an auditorium with a retractable roof that would house the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera was more specifically proposed in 1953 by the Allegheny Conference on Community Redevelopment . The following year the Public Auditorium Authority of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County was formed . The Lower Hill District had been approved by the City Planning Commission in 1950 . [ 13 ] Partially as a result of the Civic arena , the whole Hill District is estimated to only have 12,000 residents now . [ 142 ] These governmental organizations caused demographic changes through creating a mass exodus from the lower hill district for the construction of the Civic Arena . [ 13 ] In the 1960s the Urban Redevelopment Authority attempted to redevelop East Liberty with the goal of preserving its status as a market center . Penn Center Mall was the result of this effort . In the process of constructing this mall , approximately 3,800 people were forced to relocate . This proved to be another case of government intervention resulting in demographic changes . [ 143 ] Later on , in the early 2000s , movement of businesses into East Liberty , such as Home Depot , Whole Foods , and Google , created another demographic shift . This era of redevelopment was led by private developers who catered to what one scholar described as “ Florida ’ s creative class . ” This change continued to be supported by the Urban Redevelopment Authority ; particularly by the executive director Rob Stepney , who said of the redevelopment “ We had an inspired and shared vision . ” When describing the result of redevelopment he said “ East Liberty went from blighted and ‘ keep off the grass ’ to the definition of what millennials are looking for . ” [ 143 ] The Pittsburgh government ’ s choices during redevelopment and the resulting demographic changes have resulted in criticism and led some residents to believe that displacement was purposeful . In one article published in Public Source , a resident explains their belief that redevelopment plans are part of “ deconcentration , ” an effort to spread out black and low-income residents in order to prevent them from being concentrated in one place . [ 142 ] Others worry that these demographic changes are part of government complicity in gentrification . [ 144 ] Gentrification is a process where wealthier residents move into an area , altering it by increasing housing / renting costs and changing the market for businesses in the area . This displaces current residents who are unable to afford living in the changed neighborhood . In East Liberty , for example , people frequently cite housing units being demolished and replaced by businesses as evidence of gentrification . For example , when the East Mall public housing unit was demolished in 2009 , and a Target built in its place .
