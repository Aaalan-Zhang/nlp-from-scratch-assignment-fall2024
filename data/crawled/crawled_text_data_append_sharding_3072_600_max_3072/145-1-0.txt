Most locations accept reservations during restaurant week to streamline their customer service . For restaurants that do not offer online reservations , call to inquire about a dining time . MENTION RESTAURANT WEEK . When being seated and offered menus , ensure to mention Pittsburgh Restaurant Week to the waitstaff to ensure you are getting the correct menus and pricing . GRATUITIES APPRECIATED . Waitstaff handle a surge of customers during restaurant week and many of the special menus are multiple courses that would have been priced higher if ordered a la carte . If you are able , consider gratuities that take into account the original pricing and extra effort to perfect a multi-course service .
