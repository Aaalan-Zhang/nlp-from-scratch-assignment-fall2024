that drew upon environmentalism as well as popular attitudes toward capital 's treatment of labor . The Olmsted firm translated this agenda into an urban design that included a unique combination of social reform , comprehensive infrastructure planning , and private homeownership principles . The rates of homeownership and cordial relationships between the steel company and Vandergrift residents fostered loyalty among McMurtry 's skilled workers and led to McMurtry 's greatest success . In 1901 he used Vandergrift 's worker-residents to break the first major strike against the United States Steel Corporation . [ 43 ] Machine politics [ edit ] Christopher Magee and William Flinn operated powerful Republican machines that controlled local politics after 1880 . They were business owners and favored business interests . Flinn was a leader of the Progressive movement statewide and supported Theodore Roosevelt in the 1912 election . [ 44 ] Germans [ edit ] During the mid-19th century , Pittsburgh witnessed a dramatic influx of German immigrants , including a brick mason whose son , Henry J. Heinz , founded the H.J . Heinz Company in 1869 . Heinz was at the forefront of reform efforts to improve food purity , working conditions , hours , and wages , [ 45 ] but the company bitterly opposed the formation of an independent labor union . [ 46 ] Labor unions [ edit ] As a manufacturing center , Pittsburgh also became an arena for intense labor strife . During the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 , Pittsburgh workers protested and had massive demonstrations that erupted into widespread violence , known as the Pittsburgh Railway Riots . [ 47 ] Militia and federal troops were called to the city to suppress the strike . Forty men died , most of them workers , and more than 40 buildings were burned down , including the Union Depot of the Pennsylvania Railroad . Strikers also burned and destroyed rolling stock : more than 100 train engines and 1000 railcars were destroyed . It was the city with the most violence of any affected by the strikes . Burning of Pennsylvania Railroad and Union Depot , Pittsburgh , July 21–22 , 1877 In 1892 , a confrontation in the steel industry resulted in 10 deaths ( 3 detectives , 7 workers ) when Carnegie Steel Company 's manager Henry Clay Frick sent in Pinkertons to break the Homestead Strike . Labor strife continued into the years of the Great Depression , as workers sought to protect their jobs and improve working conditions . Unions organized H.J . Heinz workers , with the assistance of the Catholic Radical Alliance . Carnegie [ edit ] Andrew Carnegie , an immigrant from Scotland and a former Pennsylvania Railroad executive turned steel magnate , founded the Carnegie Steel Company . He proceeded to play a key role in the development of the U.S. steel industry . He became a philanthropist : in 1890 , he established the first Carnegie Library , in a program to establish libraries in numerous cities and towns by the incentive of matching funds . In 1895 , he founded the Carnegie Institute . In 1901 , as the U.S. Steel Corporation formed , he sold his mills to J.P. Morgan for $ 250 million , making him one of the world 's richest men . Carnegie once wrote that a man who dies rich , dies disgraced . [ 48 ] He devoted the rest of his life to public service , establishing libraries , trusts , and foundations . In Pittsburgh , he founded the Carnegie Institute of Technology ( now Carnegie Mellon University ) and the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh . [ 39 ] The third ( and present ) Allegheny County Courthouse and Jail was completed in 1886 . In 1890 , trolleys began operations . [ 27 ] In 1907 , Pittsburgh annexed Allegheny City , which is now known as the North Side . [ 27 ] Steelworker watching molten steel being poured into a mold , J & L Steel , Pittsburgh , May 1942 . Early 20th century [ edit ] By 1911 , Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial and commercial powerhouse : [ 21 ] Nexus of a vast railway system , with freight yards capable of handling 60K cars 27.2 miles ( 43.8 km ) of harbor Yearly river traffic in excess of 9M tons Value of factory products more than $ 211M ( with Allegheny City ) Allegheny county produced , as percentage of national output , about : 24 % of the pig iron 34 % of the Bessemer steel 44 % of the open hearth steel 53 % of the crucible steel 24 % of the steel rails 59 % of the structural shapes Prohibition [ edit ] During the Prohibition era , 1920 to 1933 , Pittsburgh was a hotbed of bootlegging and illicit alcohol consumption . [ 49 ] [ 50 ] Several factors fed into resistance to Prohibition , including a large immigrant population , anti-establishment animosity dating to the Whiskey Rebellion , fragmented local government , and pervasive corruption . [ 50 ] The Pittsburgh crime family controlled significant portions of the illegal alcohol trade . During that time , Prohibition Administrator John Pennington and his federal agents engaged in 15,000 raids , arrested over 18,000 people and closed down over 3,000 distilleries , 16 regular breweries , and 400 'wildcat ' breweries . [ 50 ] [ 51 ] Even the term `` Speakeasy , '' meaning an illegal drinking establishment , is said to have been coined at the Blind Pig in nearby McKeesport , Pennsylvania . [ 50 ] [ 52 ] The last distillery in Pittsburgh , Joseph S. Finch 's distillery , located at South Second and McKean streets , closed in the 1920s . [ 53 ] In 2012 , Wigle Whiskey opened , becoming the first since the closure of Finch 's distillery . [ 53 ] The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette produced a large web feature on this period in the city 's history . [ 54 ] Environment [ edit ] During the late 19th century , city leaders debated the responsibility and expense of creating a waterworks system and disposal of sewage . Downstream users complained about Pittsburgh 's dumping of sewage into the Ohio River . Allegheny County cities did not stop discharging raw sewage into rivers until 1939 . Pittsburgh 's smoke pollution , seen in the 1890s as a sign of prosperity , was recognized as a problem in the Progressive Era and was cleared up in the 1930s–1940s . Steel plants deposited mountains of slag until 1972 , especially in Nine Mile Run Valley . [ 55 ] In November 1927 , 28 people were killed and hundreds were wounded in an explosion of a gas tank . [ 56 ] To escape the soot of the city , many of the wealthy lived in the Shadyside and East End neighborhoods , a few miles east of downtown . Fifth Avenue was dubbed `` Millionaire 's Row '' because of the many mansions lining the street . On March 17 and 18 , 1936 , Pittsburgh suffered the worst flood in its history , with flood levels peaking at 46 feet . This catastrophe killed 69 victims , destroyed thousands of buildings , caused $ 3B ( 2006 dollars ) in damages , and put more than 60,000 steelworkers out of work . [ 57 ] High culture [ edit ] Oakland became the city 's predominant cultural and educational center , including three universities , multiple museums , a library , a music hall , and a botanical conservatory . Oakland 's University of Pittsburgh erected what today is still the world 's fourth-tallest educational building , the 42-story Cathedral of Learning . [ 58 ] It towered over Forbes Field , where the Pittsburgh Pirates played from 1909 to 1970 . [ 39 ] Downtown Pittsburgh panorama , from 1920 . New immigrants and migrants [ edit ] Between 1870 and 1920 , the population of Pittsburgh grew almost sevenfold , with a large number of European immigrants arriving to the city . New arrivals continue to come from Britain , Ireland , and Germany , but the most popular sources after 1870 were poor rural areas in southern and eastern Europe , including Italy , the Balkans , the Austro-Hungarian Empire , and the Russian Empire . Unskilled immigrants found jobs in construction , mining , steel mills and factories . They introduced new traditions , languages , and cultures to the city , creating a diversified society as a result . Ethnic neighborhoods developed in working-class areas and were built on densely populated hillsides and valleys , such as South Side , Polish Hill , Bloomfield , and Squirrel Hill , home to 28 % of the city 's almost 21,000 Jewish households . [ 59 ] The Strip District , the city 's produce distribution center , still boasts many restaurants and clubs that showcase these multicultural traditions of Pittsburghers . [ 39 ] African Americans [ edit ] Further information : Great Migration ( African American ) The years 1916–1940 marked the largest migration of African Americans to Pittsburgh during the Great Migration from the rural South to industrial cities of the Northeast and Midwest . These migrants came for industrial jobs , education , political and social freedom , and to escape racial oppression and violence in the South . Migrants going to Pittsburgh and surrounding mill towns faced racial discrimination and restricted housing and job opportunities . The black population in Pittsburgh jumped from 6,000 in 1880 to 27,000 in 1910 . Many took highly paid , skilled jobs in the steel mills . Pittsburgh 's black population increased to 37,700 in 1920 ( 6.4 % of the total ) while the black element in Homestead , Rankin , Braddock , and others nearly doubled . They succeeded in building effective community responses that enabled the survival of new communities . [ 60 ] [ 61 ] Historian Joe Trotter explains the decision process : Although African-Americans often expressed their views of the Great Migration in biblical terms and received encouragement from northern black newspapers , railroad companies , and industrial labor agents , they also drew upon family and friendship networks to help in the move to Western Pennsylvania . They formed migration clubs , pooled their money , bought tickets at reduced rates , and often moved ingroups . Before they made the decision to move , they gathered information and debated the pros and cons of the process .... In barbershops , poolrooms , and grocery stores , in churches , lodge halls , and clubhouses , and in private homes , southern blacks discussed , debated , and decided what was good and what was bad about moving to the urban North . [ 62 ] The newly established Black communities nearly all endured , apart from Johnstown where blacks were expelled in 1923 . Joe Trotter explains how the Blacks built new institutions for their new communities in the Pittsburgh area : Black churches , fraternal orders , and newspapers ( especially the Pittsburgh Courier ) ; organizations such as the NAACP , Urban League , and Garvey Movement ; social clubs , restaurants , and baseball teams ; hotels , beauty shops , barber shops , and taverns , all proliferated . [ 63 ] The cultural nucleus of Black Pittsburgh was Wylie Avenue in the Hill District . It became an important jazz mecca because jazz greats such as Duke Ellington and Pittsburgh natives Billy Strayhorn and Earl Hines played there . Two of the Negro League 's greatest baseball rivals , the Pittsburgh Crawfords and the Homestead Grays , often competed in the Hill District . The teams dominated the Negro National League in the 1930s and 1940s . [ 39 ] 1930s [ edit ] Pittsburgh was a Republican stronghold starting in the 1880s , [ 64 ] and the Republican governments provided jobs and assistance for the new immigrants in return for their votes . But the Great Depression starting in 1929 ruined the GOP in the city . The Democratic victory of 1932 meant an end to Republican patronage jobs and assistance . As the Depression worsened , Pittsburgh ethnics voted heavily for the Democrats , especially in 1934 , making the city a stronghold of the New Deal Coalition . By 1936 , Democratic programs for relief and jobs , especially the WPA , were so popular with the ethnics that a large majority voted for the Democrats . [ 65 ] [ 66 ] Joseph Guffey , statewide leader of the Democrats , and his local lieutenant David Lawrence gained control of all federal patronage in Pittsburgh after Roosevelt 's landslide victory in 1932 and the election of a Democratic mayor in 1933 . Guffey and Lawrence used the New Deal programs to increase their political power and build up a Democratic machine that superseded the decaying Republican machine . Guffey acknowledged that a high rate of people on relief was not only `` a challenge '' but also `` an opportunity . '' He regarded each relief job as Democratic patronage . [ 67 ] 1940s [ edit ] Pittsburgh was at the center of the `` Arsenal of Democracy `` that provided steel , aluminum , munitions and machinery for the U.S. during World War II . Pittsburgh 's mills contributed 95 million tons of steel to the war effort . The increased production output created a workforce shortage , which resulted in African Americans moving en masse during the Second Great Migration from the South to the city in order to find work . [ 11 ] Postwar [ edit ] David Lawrence , a Democrat , served as mayor of Pittsburgh from 1946 to 1959 and as Pennsylvania 's governor from 1959 to 1963 . [ 68 ] Lawrence used his political power to transform Pittsburgh 's political machine into a modern governmental unit that could run the city well and honestly . [ 69 ] In 1946 Lawrence decided to enforce the Smoke Control Ordinance of 1941 because he believed smoke abatement was crucial for the city 's future economic development . However , enforcement placed a substantial burden on the city 's working-class because smoky bituminous coal was much less expensive than smokeless fuels . One round of protests came from Italian-American organizations , which called for delay in enforcing it . Enforcement raised their cost of living and threatened the jobs of their relatives in nearby bituminous coal mines . Despite dislike of the smoke abatement program , Italian Americans strongly supported the reelection of Lawrence in 1949 , in part because many of them were on the city payroll .

For the basketball team , see Pittsburgh Rens . The multi-purpose Three Rivers Stadium was built in 1970 as part of the Renaissance I project . It was imploded in 2001 . Rich and productive , Pittsburgh was also the `` Smoky City , '' with smog sometimes so thick that streetlights burned during the day [ 11 ] as well as rivers that resembled open sewers . Civic leaders , notably Mayor David L. Lawrence , elected in 1945 , Richard K. Mellon , chairman of Mellon Bank and John P. Robin [ 71 ] [ 72 ] began smoke control and urban revitalization , also known as Urban Renewal projects that transformed the city [ 11 ] in unforeseen ways . `` Renaissance I '' began in 1946 . Title One of the Housing Act of 1949 provided the means in which to begin . By 1950 , vast swaths of buildings and land near the Point were demolished for Gateway Center . 1953 saw the opening of the ( since demolished ) Greater Pittsburgh Municipal Airport terminal . [ 27 ] In the late 1950s and early 1960s , the lower Hill District , an area inhabited predominantly by poor Blacks , was completely destroyed . Ninety-five acres of the lower Hill District were cleared using eminent domain , forcibly displacing hundreds of small businesses and more than 8,000 people ( 1,239 black families , 312 white ) , to make room for a cultural center that included the Civic Arena , which opened in 1961 . [ 73 ] Other than one apartment building , none of the other buildings planned for the cultural center were ever built . In the early 1960s , the neighborhood of East Liberty was also included in Renaissance I Urban Renewal plans , with over 125 acres ( 0.51 km 2 ) of the neighborhood being demolished and replaced with garden apartments , three 20-story public housing apartments , and a convoluted road-way system that circled a pedestrianized shopping district . In the span of just a few years during the mid-1960s , East Liberty became a blighted neighborhood . There were some 575 businesses in East Liberty in 1959 , but only 292 in 1970 , and just 98 in 1979 . Preservation efforts by the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation , along with community neighborhood groups , resisted the demolition plans . The neighborhoods containing rich architectural heritage , including the Mexican War Streets , Allegheny West , and Manchester , were spared . The center of Allegheny City , with its culturally and socially important buildings , was not as lucky . All of the buildings , with the exception of the Old U.S. Post Office , the Carnegie Library , and Buhl Planetarium were destroyed and replaced with the `` pedestrianized '' Allegheny Center Mall and apartments . The city 's industrial base continued to grow in the post-war era [ 74 ] partly assisted by the area 's first agency entirely devoted to industrial development , the RIDC . [ 75 ] [ 76 ] Jones and Laughlin Steel Company expanded its plant on the Southside . H.J . Heinz , Pittsburgh Plate Glass , Alcoa , Westinghouse , U.S. Steel and its new division , the Pittsburgh Chemical Company and many other companies also continued robust operations through the 1960s . [ 11 ] 1970 marked the completion of the final building projects of Renaissance I : the U.S. Steel Tower and Three Rivers Stadium . [ 27 ] In 1974 , with the addition of the fountain at the tip of the Golden Triangle , Point State Park was completed . [ 77 ] Although air quality was dramatically improved , and Pittsburgh 's manufacturing base seemed solid , questions abound about the negative effects Urban Renewal continues to have on the social fabric of Pittsburgh . Pittsburgh , however , was about to undergo one of its most dramatic transformations . Like most major cities , Pittsburgh experienced several days of rioting following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in April 1968 . There were no further major riots , although tension remained high in the inner-city black neighborhoods .
