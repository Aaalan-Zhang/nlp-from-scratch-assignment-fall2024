The region 's counties also fall within the borders of Appalachia as defined by the Appalachian Regional Commission . [ 29 ] The City of Pittsburgh has been characterized as the `` northern urban industrial anchor of Appalachia '' [ 30 ] : which makes it an anomaly compared to much of Appalachia which has traditionally been characterized as southern , rural , and economically distressed . [ 30 ] Joseph Scarpaci , professor emeritus of geography at Virginia Tech , [ 31 ] has described Pittsburgh as having `` one foot in the East ... and the other in the Midwest '' . [ 30 ] Barbara Johnstone , professor of rhetoric and linguistics at Carnegie Mellon University , ascribes this isolation and idiosyncratic cultural identity of the region to the difficulty of moving through the Allegheny Mountains and the Allegheny Plateau . The Pittsburgh area was sort of isolated . It was very hard to get back and forth across the mountains . There 's always been a sense that Pittsburgh was kind of a place unto itselfâ€”not really southern , not really Midwestern , not really part of Pennsylvania . People just did n't move very much . [ 32 ] In his 2009 book , The Paris of Appalachia , Pittsburgh Post-Gazette writer Brian O'Neill meditates on this aspect of Pittsburgh 's regional and cultural ambiguity . The title of the book is intentionally provocative : `` The Paris of Appalachia '' some have called Pittsburgh derisively , because it 's still the largest city along this gorgeous mountain chain that needs a better press agent . I 've long felt we should embrace that title , though few are with me . Several tried to talk me out of slapping it on the cover , but were we called `` The Paris of the Rockies , '' we would n't run from it . Sometimes we 're so afraid of what others think , we 're afraid to say who we are . This city is not Midwestern . It 's not East Coast . It 's just Pittsburgh , and there 's no place like it . That 's both its blessing and its curse . [ 33 ] Arts [ edit ] Visual arts [ edit ] Greater Pittsburgh is home to several museums , galleries , and organizations which promote appreciation for the visual arts . The largest art museum in the region is the Carnegie Museum of Art , founded in 1895 by industrialist Andrew Carnegie and located in Pittsburgh 's Oakland neighborhood . It is renowned for its collections of 19th and 20th century decorative art , Japanese prints , and old master prints . [ 34 ] Contemporary art museums include the Mattress Factory and the Andy Warhol Museum , both located on Pittsburgh 's North Side . [ 35 ] [ 36 ] Other regional visual arts museums include : [ 37 ] [ 38 ] Frick Art and Historical Center ( Point Breeze , Pittsburgh ) Contemporary Craft ( Strip District , Pittsburgh ) ToonSeum ( Downtown , Pittsburgh ) Westmoreland Museum of American Art ( Greensburg ) Southern Alleghenies Museum of Art ( Multiple locations - Loretto , Ligonier Valley , Johnstown , and Altoona ) [ 39 ] The Maridon Museum ( Butler ) University Museum at Indiana University of Pennsylvania ( Indiana ) Hoyt Institute of Fine Arts ( New Castle ) Venango Museum of Art , Science , and Industry ( Oil City ) Palmer Museum of Art ( University Park ) Erie Art Museum ( Erie ) Juniata College Museum of Art ( Huntingdon ) Art Museum of West Virginia University ( Morgantown ) Sports and recreation [ edit ] Main article : Sports in Pittsburgh PNC Park in the North Shore neighborhood , home of the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team since 2001 The Pittsburgh area served as a launchpad for the professionalization of both American football and ice hockey in the 1890s and 1900s . The first professional player ( William Heffelfinger ) played for a Pittsburgh football team in 1892 , which was followed by the first open professional ( John Brallier ) , the first all-professional team ( the Latrobe Athletic Association ) , and a participant in the first all-professional league ( the Pittsburgh Stars of the first National Football League ) . In the case of ice hockey , the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League was the first hockey league to pay its players in 1901 , eventually merging into the first fully pro league , the International Professional Hockey League , in 1904 . Professional hockey in Pennsylvania predated the professionalization of the game in Canada ( where it eventually came to dominate in the early 20th century ) by four years . Today , the region is home to three major league franchises in baseball , football , and hockey ; several minor league teams in soccer , baseball , and hockey ; and three major NCAA universities .
