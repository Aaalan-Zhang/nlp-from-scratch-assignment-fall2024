The Alcoa Foundation sponsored the programs , which ran for three years and became the highest rated classical music series on PBS . The program showcased the diversity of Music Director Andre Previn 's musical interests , talents and friends . The first program explored Mozart , with Previn and the Pittsburgh Symphony 's Patricia Prattis Jennings playing four-handed piano sonatas . Others featured guest artists John Williams , conducting his music from `` Star Wars '' and `` E.T. , '' Ella Fitzgerald , Yo-Yo Ma , Pittsburgh Symphony principal cello Nathaniel Rosen ( the first American cellist to win the gold medal at the Tchaikovsky International Competition ) , composer Stephen Sondheim and violinist Itzhak Perlman . Composer Miklos Rosza appeared as a guest to hear the Pittsburgh Symphony play his Oscar-winning score for the movie `` Ben-Hur . '' Previn displayed his considerable talent as a jazz pianist in a duet with his friend Oscar Peterson , the man Duke Ellington dubbed `` the maharajah of the keyboard . '' When cameras came into Heinz Hall to film the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra rehearsing in their shirtsleeves , audiences saw a relaxed maestro in bellbottoms who obviously liked and respected the musicians . The first show aired on February 27 , 1977 , and within two days the Pittsburgh Symphony sold more than 2,500 additional seats . [ 67 ] Pittsburgh Symphony Radio [ edit ] Launched in 1982 , the Pittsburgh Symphony Radio program is hosted by Jim Cunningham of WQED-FM . It is a complete two-hour concert with Music Director Manfred Honeck and guest artists heard on over 100 PRI and NPR stations across the country . The Pittsburgh Symphony was first broadcast in 1936 when NBC Blue Network began a series of 26 half-hour radio broadcasts over the NBC Blue Network of more than 90 stations . The broadcasts were sponsored by Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company . [ 68 ] [ 69 ] Heinz Hall history [ edit ] Main article : Heinz Hall for the Performing Arts A $ 10-million reconstruction of the theater took place between 1967 and 1971 . Although much of the structure and décor remained the same , a new five-story wing was added to the back of the building . This wing expanded the stage and rehearsal space along with the music library and dressing rooms . [ 70 ] [ 71 ] Several concerts took place before the remodel and reopening of the Hall in 1971 , including a performance of works by Berlioz , Beethoven and Brahms by the Leonard Rose , Isaac Stern and Eugene Istomin Trio for the 1969 pension fund concert . Questionnaires filled out by symphony followers were collected after the concert and reflected an overwhelming support of the new venue . [ 72 ] Heinz Hall was dedicated in September 1971 . The inaugural concerts took place on September 10 and 11 with William Steinberg conducting Beethoven 's `` Consecration of the House '' overture and Mahler 's Symphony No . 2 ( `` Resurrection '' ) with a combined chorus of Pennsylvania State University choirs . The New York Times published an outstanding review of the performances , citing the improvement of the acoustics over previous Symphony venues saying , `` Pittsburghers at last have the opportunity to hear ( the orchestra ) as it ought to sound . '' [ 73 ] The Garden Plaza and a four-story addition to the Hall were completed in 1982 by the firm of MacLachlan , Cornelius & Filoni . The plaza included a waterfall and sculpture by London-based artist Angela Connor . The addition to the Hall included two bar/lounge spaces as well as a dining and meeting room . In addition , some public areas were refurbished into reception facilities in 1988 . [ 71 ] A $ 6.5-million renovation began in 1995 with funding provided by the Howard Heinz Endowment and Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Strategy 21 program funds . The renovation improved the acoustical , technical and aesthetic qualities of the Hall and was carried out by Architect Albert Filoni , of MacLachlan , Cornelius & Filoni , along with acoustician R. Lawrence Kirkegaard . The Hall reopened with a ribbon cutting ceremony by Governor Tom Ridge and Teresa Heinz .
