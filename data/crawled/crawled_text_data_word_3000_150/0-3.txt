in consultation with Veolia had changed what chemicals they were using to prevent metal corrosion in 2014 , [ 110 ] from soda ash to caustic soda , without consulting with Department of Environmental Protection . [ 112 ] Anti-corrosive chemicals were being used because many of Pittsburgh 's water pipes were made of lead , and adding anti-corrosive chemicals helped prevent lead from seeping into drinking water . [ 112 ] In 2016 lead levels were as high as 27 ppb in some cases . The legal limit is 15 ppb , although there is not a safe amount of lead in drinking water . [ 112 ] Though lead levels had been rising in previous years , they had not exceeded the legal limit . [ 110 ] In late 2015 PWSA terminated its contracted with Veolia . [ 111 ] In response to the high lead levels PWSA began adding orthophosphate to the water . [ 113 ] Orthophosphate is meant to create a coating on the inside of pipes , creating a barrier to prevent lead from leaching into drinking water . [ 113 ] PWSA has also been working to replace lead pipes , and continuing to test water for lead . [ 113 ] There remains concern among residents over the long-term effects of this lead , particularly for children , in whom lead causes permanent damage to the brain and nervous system . [ 114 ] Some people also believe that the high levels of lead reflect environmental racism , as black and Hispanic children in Pittsburgh experience elevated blood-lead levels at 4 times the rate of white children . [ 114 ] Water fountains in Langley k-8 school in Sheraden were found to have the highest levels of lead of any schools in the Pittsburgh area . These levels were about 11 times the legal limit . Some residents believe this is due to Langely being a predominantly black school , with 89 % of the student body being eligible for the free lunch program .

Each dot is 25 people : ⬤ White ⬤ Black ⬤ Asian ⬤ Hispanic ⬤ Other At the 2010 census , there were 305,704 people residing in Pittsburgh , a decrease of 8.6 % since 2000 ; 66.0 % of the population was White , 25.8 % Black or African American , 0.2 % American Indian and Alaska Native , 4.4 % Asian , 0.3 % Other , and 2.3 % mixed ; in 2020 , 2.3 % of Pittsburgh 's population was of Hispanic or Latino American origin of any race . Non-Hispanic whites were 64.8 % of the population in 2010 , [ 119 ] compared to 78.7 % in 1970 . [ 120 ] By the 2020 census , the population slightly declined further to 302,971 . [ 118 ] Its racial and ethnic makeup in 2020 was 64.7 % non-Hispanic white , 23.0 % Black or African American , 5.8 % Asian , and 3.2 % Hispanic or Latino American of any race . Since the beginning of the 21st century , the five largest European ethnic groups in Pittsburgh were German ( 19.7 % ) , Irish ( 15.8 % ) , Italian ( 11.8 % ) , Polish ( 8.4 % ) , and English ( 4.6 % ) , while the metropolitan area is approximately 22 % German-American , 15.4 % Italian American and 11.6 % Irish American . Pittsburgh has one of the largest Italian-American communities in the nation , [ 126 ] and the fifth-largest Ukrainian community per the 1990 census . [ 127 ] Pittsburgh has one of the most extensive Croatian communities in the United States . [ 128 ] Overall , the Pittsburgh metro area has one of the largest populations of Slavic Americans in the country . Pittsburgh has a sizable Black and African American population , concentrated in various neighborhoods especially in the East End . There is also a small Asian community consisting of Indian immigrants , and a small Hispanic community consisting of Mexicans and Puerto Ricans . [ 129 ] According to a 2010 Association of Religion Data Archives ( ARDA ) study , residents include 773,341 `` Catholics '' ; 326,125 `` Mainline Protestants '' ; 174,119 `` Evangelical Protestants ; '' 20,976 `` Black Protestants ; '' and 16,405 `` Orthodox Christians , '' with 996,826 listed as `` unclaimed '' and 16,405 as `` other '' in the metro area . [ 129 ] A 2017 study by the Cohen Center for Modern Jewish Studies at Brandeis University estimated the Jewish population of Greater Pittsburgh was 49,200 . [ 130 ] Pittsburgh is also cited as the location where the earliest precursor to Jehovah 's Witnesses was founded by Charles Taze Russell ; today the denomination makes up approximately 1 % of the population based on data from the Pew Research Center . [ 131 ] [ 132 ] According to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center , 78 % of the population of the city identified themselves as Christians , with 42 % professing attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered Protestant , and 32 % professing Catholic beliefs . while 18 % claim no religious affiliation . The same study says that other religions ( including Judaism , Buddhism , Islam , and Hinduism ) collectively make up about 4 % of the population .

The average household size was 2.17 and the average family size was 2.95 . In the city , the population was spread out , with 19.9 % under the age of 18 , 14.8 % from 18 to 24 , 28.6 % from 25 to 44 , 20.3 % from 45 to 64 , and 16.4 % who were 65 years of age or older . The median age was 36 years . For every 100 females , there were 90.7 males . For every 100 females age 18 and over , there were 87.8 males . The median income for a household in the city was $ 28,588 , and the median income for a family was $ 38,795 . Males had a median income of $ 32,128 versus $ 25,500 for females . The per capita income for the city was $ 18,816 . About 15.0 % of families and 20.4 % of the population were below the poverty line , including 27.5 % of those under the age of 18 and 13.5 % ages 65 or older . By the 2019 American Community Survey , the median income for a household increased to $ 53,799 . [ 134 ] Families had a median income of $ 68,922 ; married-couple families had a median income of $ 93,500 ; and non-family households had a median income of $ 34,448 . Pittsburgh 's wealthiest suburbs within city limits are Squirrel Hill and Point Breeze , the only two areas of the city which have average household incomes over $ 100,000 a year . Outside of city limits , Sewickley Heights is by a wide margin the wealthiest suburb of Pittsburgh within Allegheny County , with an average yearly household income of just over $ 218,000 . Sewickely Heights is seen as one of Pittsburgh 's wealthiest suburbs culturally as well , titles which the suburbs of Upper St. Clair , Fox Chapel , Wexford , and Warrendale also have been bestowed . [ 135 ] [ 136 ] In a 2002 study , Pittsburgh ranked 22nd of 69 urban places in the U.S. in the number of residents 25 years or older who had completed a bachelor 's degree , at 31 % . [ 137 ] Pittsburgh ranked 15th of the 69 places in the number of residents 25 years or older who completed a high school degree , at 84.7 % . [ 138 ] The metro area has shown greater residential racial integration during the last 30 years . The 2010 census ranked 18 other U.S. metros as having greater black-white segregation , while 32 other U.S. metros rank higher for black-white isolation . [ 139 ] As of 2018 , much of Pittsburgh 's population density was concentrated in the central , southern , and eastern areas . The city limits itself have a population density of 5,513 people per square mile ; its most densely populated parts are North Oakland ( at 21,200 per square mile ) and Uptown Pittsburgh ( at 19,869 per square mile ) . Outside of the city limits , Dormont and Mount Oliver are Pittsburgh 's most densely-populated neighborhoods , with 11,167 and 9,902 people per square mile respectively . [ 140 ] Most of Pittsburgh 's immigrants are from China , India , Korea and Italy . [ 141 ] Demographic changes [ edit ] Since the 1940s , some demographic changes have sometimes been caused by city initiatives for redevelopment . Throughout the 1950s Pittsburgh 's Lower Hill District faced massive demographic changes when 1,551 , majority black , residents and 413 businesses were forced to relocate when the city of Pittsburgh used eminent domain to make space for the construction of the Civic Arena . [ 13 ] This Civic Arena ultimately opened in 1961 . [ 13 ] The Civic Arena was built as part of one of Pittsburgh 's revitalization campaigns . An auditorium in this space was initially proposed in 1947 by the Regional Planning Association and Urban Redevelopment Authority . The idea of an auditorium with a retractable roof that would house the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera was more specifically proposed in 1953 by the Allegheny Conference on Community Redevelopment . The following year the Public Auditorium Authority of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County was formed . The Lower Hill District had been approved by the City Planning Commission in 1950 . [ 13 ] Partially as a result of the Civic arena , the whole Hill District is estimated to only have 12,000 residents now . [ 142 ] These governmental organizations caused demographic changes through creating a mass exodus from the lower hill district for the construction of the Civic Arena . [ 13 ] In the 1960s the Urban Redevelopment Authority attempted to redevelop East Liberty with the goal of preserving its status as a market center . Penn Center Mall was the result of this effort . In the process of constructing this mall , approximately 3,800 people were forced to relocate . This proved to be another case of government intervention resulting in demographic changes . [ 143 ] Later on , in the early 2000s , movement of businesses into East Liberty , such as Home Depot , Whole Foods , and Google , created another demographic shift . This era of redevelopment was led by private developers who catered to what one scholar described as “ Florida ’ s creative class. ” This change continued to be supported by the Urban Redevelopment Authority ; particularly by the executive director Rob Stepney , who said of the redevelopment “ We had an inspired and shared vision. ” When describing the result of redevelopment he said “ East Liberty went from blighted and ‘ keep off the grass ’ to the definition of what millennials are looking for. ” [ 143 ] The Pittsburgh government ’ s choices during redevelopment and the resulting demographic changes have resulted in criticism and led some residents to believe that displacement was purposeful . In one article published in Public Source , a resident explains their belief that redevelopment plans are part of “ deconcentration , ” an effort to spread out black and low-income residents in order to prevent them from being concentrated in one place . [ 142 ] Others worry that these demographic changes are part of government complicity in gentrification . [ 144 ] Gentrification is a process where wealthier residents move into an area , altering it by increasing housing / renting costs and changing the market for businesses in the area . This displaces current residents who are unable to afford living in the changed neighborhood . In East Liberty , for example , people frequently cite housing units being demolished and replaced by businesses as evidence of gentrification . For example , when the East Mall public housing unit was demolished in 2009 , and a Target built in its place . [ 145 ] Economy [ edit ] Main article : Economy of Pittsburgh See also : List of corporations in Pittsburgh Pittsburgh has adapted since the collapse of its century-long steel and electronics industries . The region has shifted to high technology , robotics , health care , nuclear engineering , tourism , biomedical technology , finance , education , and services . Annual payroll of the region 's technology industries , when taken in aggregate , exceeded $ 10.8 billion in 2007 , [ 146 ] and in 2010 there were 1,600 technology companies . [ 147 ] A National Bureau of Economic Research 2014 report named Pittsburgh the second-best U.S. city for intergenerational economic mobility [ 148 ] or the American Dream . [ 149 ] Reflecting the citywide shift from industry to technology , former factories have been renovated as modern office space . Google has research and technology offices in a refurbished 1918–1998 Nabisco factory , a complex known as Bakery Square . [ 150 ] Some of the factory 's original equipment , such as a large dough mixer , were left standing in homage to the site 's industrial roots . [ 151 ] Pittsburgh 's transition from its industrial heritage has earned it praise as `` the poster child for managing industrial transition '' . [ 152 ] Other major cities in the northeast and mid-west have increasingly borrowed from Pittsburgh 's model in order to renew their industries and economic base . [ 153 ] The largest employer in the city is the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center , with 48,000 employees . All hospitals , outpatient clinics , and doctor 's office positions combine for 116,000 jobs , approximately 10 % of the jobs in the region . An analyst recently observed of the city 's medical sector : `` That 's both more jobs and a higher share of the region 's total employment than the steel industry represented in the 1970s . '' [ 154 ] Top publicly traded companies in the Pittsburgh region for 2022 ( ranked by revenues ) with metropolitan and U.S. ranks Metro corporation US 1 The Kraft Heinz Company 139 2 U.S. Steel 172 3 PNC Financial Services 178 4 Viatris 204 5 PPG Industries 218 6 Dick 's Sporting Goods 307 7 Alcoa 312 8 WESCO International 357 9 Wabtec 439 10 Arconic 452 Education is a major economic driver in the region .
