It has taken place in Downtown Pittsburgh every summer since 2015 ( excluding 2020 ) , [ 1 ] originally on the Three Sisters bridges and along the Allegheny Riverfront , before relocating to the Boulevard of the Allies and PPG Place for its 2023 installment . [ 2 ] [ 3 ] The festival showcases `` all things pickled , '' including pickle-flavored beer and cocktails , pickle ice cream , and other pickled foods such as dilly beans and kimchi . [ 2 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] It also features live music , children 's activities , and an annual pickle juice drinking competition , the winner of which is crowned the `` Mayor of Picklesburgh '' . [ 3 ] The festival 's centerpiece is a 35-foot-long ( 11 m ) Heinz pickle balloon . [ 6 ] Picklesburgh was voted the `` best specialty food festival in America '' in USA Today readers ' polls in 2021 , 2022 , and 2023 . [ 7 ] History [ edit ] The inaugural Picklesburgh festival took place on July 17 and 18 , 2015 , on the Rachel Carson Bridge in Downtown Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . [ 2 ] Organized by the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership , a non-profit organization , and sponsored primarily by Pittsburgh-based Heinz ( now Kraft Heinz ) , the festival was inspired by Pittsburgh 's rich history of pickling . [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership president Jeremy Waldrup explained that pickles `` speak to the ethnic , cultural history of Pittsburgh , as a melting pot for Eastern European ethnic communities '' , [ 10 ] although numerous countries of Western culture with significant diasporas in the United States , like Germany and Poland , also employ pickling in their national cuisines . According to Waldrup , the festival was also inspired by the growing farm-to-table movement and the trend of urban homesteading . [ 8 ] At Picklesburgh 2016 , the second annual festival held at Rachel Carson Bridge , Heinz debuted their first new pickle flavors in over 50 years . [ 11 ] The 2017 festival was held at the nearby Roberto Clemente Bridge , where it also took place in 2018 and 2019 , gradually taking up more abutting street space each year . [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Having begun as a two-day festival in 2015 , a three-day schedule was established in 2018 , which was further expanded to four days in 2024 . [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Picklesburgh was canceled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic , but it returned in August 2021 with additional safety precautions on the Andy Warhol Bridge . [ 16 ] In 2022 , the festival returned to its original locale on the Rachel Carson Bridge , with food vendors along the neighboring 10th Street Bypass . [ 17 ] Picklesburgh 2022 drew 90,000 attendees , leading organizers to periodically close the Rachel Carson Bridge to prevent overcrowding . [ 18 ] Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership director Jack Dougherty remarked , `` At times , especially during our peak hours , it would get very crowded and just kind of become a little uncomfortable for everyone in attendance . '' [ 19 ] In response , for its 2023 installment , the festival was relocated to a larger venue occupying three blocks of the Boulevard of the Allies between Stanwix Street and Smithfield Street , and along Market Street into PPG Place . [ 6 ] Even with its larger location , Picklesburgh 2023 still saw enormous shoulder-to-shoulder crowds , with attendance more than doubling to 200,000 visitors . [ 20 ] Amid mid-summer heat and huge crowds , 16 attendees were hospitalized due to heat exhaustion and other ailments . [ 21 ] Pickle juice drinking competition [ edit ] Contestants prepare for the pickle juice drinking competition at Picklesburgh 2022 Since its founding in 2015 , every Picklesburgh festival has featured a pickle juice drinking competition as its headline event . [ 22 ] In the competition , contestants race to drink a quart -sized jar of pickle juice without regurgitating , spilling , or leaving any juice in the jar . [ 9 ] [ 22 ] The winner is dubbed the `` Mayor of Picklesburgh '' and receives a belt and a $ 500 cash prize , as of 2023 . [ 9 ] [ 23 ] The 2023 champion and reigning `` Mayor of Picklesburgh '' is Pittsburgh native Dan Koba , who drank the jar of pickle juice in 7 seconds . [ 22 ] The all-time record was set at Picklesburgh 2022 , when Wisconsin -based TikTok content creator Jalen Franko won the competition by drinking the quart of juice in 4.5 seconds .
