the `` lower town , '' near the fort 's ramparts , and the `` upper town , '' along the Monongahela as far as present-day Market Street . In April 1761 , a census ordered by Colonel Henry Bouquet and conducted by William Clapham counted 332 people and 104 houses . [ 21 ] [ 22 ] : 148 After Britain 's victory in the French and Indian War , increasing dissatisfaction among Native Americans with the continuing encroachment of settlers on lands that had been agreed would be Indian-occupied ( both in the 1758 Treaty of Easton and in the Royal Proclamation of 1763 the British authorities had decreed that there would be no British-American settlements west of the Alleghenies , but the authorities had been unable or unwilling to enforce these decrees ) led to the outbreak of Pontiac 's War . The Odawa leader Pontiac launched an offensive against British forts in May 1763 . Native American tribes from the Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes overran numerous British forts ; one of their most important targets was Fort Pitt . Receiving warning of the coming attack , Captain Simeon Ecuyer , the Swiss officer in command of the garrison , prepared for a siege . He leveled the houses outside the ramparts and ordered all settlers into the fort : 330 men , 104 women , and 196 children sought refuge inside its ramparts . [ 11 ] Captain Ecuyer also gathered stores , which included hundreds of barrels of pork and beef . Pontiac 's forces attacked the fort on June 22 , 1763 , and the siege of Fort Pitt lasted for two months . [ 15 ] Pontiac 's warriors kept up a continuous , though ineffective , fire on it from July 27 through August 1 , 1763 . [ 21 ] They drew off to confront the relieving party under Colonel Bouquet , which defeated them in the Battle of Bushy Run . [ 21 ] This victory ensured British dominion over the forks of the Ohio , if not the entire Ohio valley . In 1764 Colonel Bouquet added a redoubt , the Fort Pitt Blockhouse , which still stands , the sole remaining structure from Fort Pitt and the oldest authenticated building west of the Allegheny Mountains . [ 15 ] Fort Pitt , 1795 The Iroquois signed the Fort Stanwix Treaty of 1768 , ceding the lands south of the Ohio to the British Crown . [ 21 ] European expansion into the upper Ohio valley increased . An estimated 4,000 to 5,000 families settled in western Pennsylvania between 1768 and 1770 . Of these settlers , about a third were English-American , another third were Scotch-Irish , and the rest were Welsh , German and others . [ 23 ] These groups tended to settle together in small farming communities , but often their households were not within hailing distance . The life of a settler family was one of relentless hard work : clearing the forest , stumping the fields , building cabins and barns , planting , weeding , and harvesting . In addition , almost everything was manufactured by hand , including furniture , tools , candles , buttons , and needles . [ 23 ] Settlers had to deal with harsh winters , and with snakes , black bears , mountain lions , and timber wolves . Because of the fear of raids by Native Americans , the settlers often built their cabins near , or even on top of , springs , to ensure access to water . They also built blockhouses , where neighbors would rally during conflicts . [ 4 ] Increasing violence , especially by the Shawnee , Miami , and Wyandot tribes , led to Dunmore 's War in 1774 . Conflict with Native Americans continued throughout the Revolutionary War , as some hoped that the war would end with expulsion of the settlers from their territory . In 1777 , Fort Pitt became a United States fort , when Brigadier General Edward Hand took command . In 1779 , Colonel Daniel Brodhead led 600 men from Fort Pitt to destroy Seneca villages along the upper Allegheny . [ 4 ] With the war still ongoing , in 1780 Virginia and Pennsylvania came to an agreement on their mutual borders , creating the state lines known today and determining finally that the jurisdiction of Pittsburgh region was Pennsylvanian . In 1783 , the Revolutionary War ended , which also brought at least a temporary cessation of border warfare . In the 1784 Treaty of Fort Stanwix , the Iroquois ceded the land north of the Purchase Line to Pennsylvania . [ 4 ] Map of Pittsburgh in 1795 After the Revolution , the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow . One of its earliest industries was boat building . Flatboats could be used to carry large numbers of pioneers and goods downriver , while keelboats were capable of traveling upriver . [ 24 ] The village began to develop vital institutions . Hugh Henry Brackenridge , a Pittsburgh resident and state legislator , introduced a bill that resulted in a gift deed of land and a charter for the Pittsburgh Academy on February 28 , 1787 . The academy later developed as the University of Western Pennsylvania ( 1819 ) and since 1908 has been known as the University of Pittsburgh . [ 25 ] Many farmers distilled their corn harvest into whiskey , increasing its value while lowering its transportation costs . At that time , whiskey was used as a form of currency on the frontier . When the federal government imposed an excise tax on whiskey , Western Pennsylvania farmers felt victimized , leading to the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794 . Farmers from the region rallied at Braddock 's Field and marched on Pittsburgh . The short-lived rebellion was put down , however , when President George Washington sent in militias from several states . [ 20 ] The town continued to grow in manufacturing capability . In 1792 , the boatyards in Pittsburgh built a sloop , Western Experiment . [ 26 ] During the next decades , the yards produced other large boats . By the 19th century , they were building ocean-going vessels that shipped goods as far as Europe . In 1794 , the town 's first courthouse was built ; it was a wooden structure on Market Square . [ 11 ] In 1797 , the manufacture of glass began . [ 27 ] Year City Population [ 11 ] [ 21 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] : 80 [ 30 ] 1761 332 1796 1,395 1800 1,565 Iron City ( 1800–1859 ) [ edit ] Second Court House , completed 1841 [ 31 ] Commerce continued to be an essential part of the economy of early Pittsburgh , but increasingly , manufacture began to grow in importance . Pittsburgh was located in the middle of one of the most productive coalfields in the country ; the region was also rich in petroleum , natural gas , lumber , and farm goods . Blacksmiths forged iron implements , from horse shoes to nails . By 1800 , the town , with a population of 1,565 persons , had over 60 shops , including general stores , bakeries , and hat and shoe shops . [ 11 ] The 1810s were a critical decade in Pittsburgh 's growth . In 1811 , the first steamboat was built in Pittsburgh . Increasingly , commerce would also flow upriver . The War of 1812 catalyzed growth of the Iron City . The war with Britain , the manufacturing center of the world , cut off the supply of British goods , stimulating American manufacture . [ 11 ] In addition , the British blockade of the American coast increased inland trade , so that goods flowed through Pittsburgh from all four directions . By 1815 , Pittsburgh was producing $ 764K in iron ; $ 249K in brass and tin , and $ 235K in glass products . [ 11 ] When , on March 18 , 1816 , Pittsburgh was incorporated as a city , it had already taken on some of its defining characteristics : commerce , manufacture , and a constant cloud of coal dust . [ 32 ] Other emerging towns challenged Pittsburgh . In 1818 , the first segment of the National Road was completed , from Baltimore to Wheeling , bypassing Pittsburgh . This threatened to render the town less essential in east–west commerce . In the coming decade , however , many improvements were made to the transportation infrastructure . In 1818 , the region 's first river bridge , the Smithfield Street Bridge , opened , the first step in developing the `` City of bridges '' over its two rivers . [ citation needed ] On October 1 , 1840 , the original Pennsylvania Turnpike was completed , connecting Pittsburgh and the eastern port city of Philadelphia . In 1834 , the Pennsylvania Main Line Canal was completed , making Pittsburgh part of a transportation system that included rivers , roads , and canals . [ 27 ] Manufacture continued to grow . In 1835 , McClurg , Wade and Co. built the first locomotive west of the Alleghenies . Already , Pittsburgh was capable of manufacturing the most essential machines of its age . By the 1840s , Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the mountains . In 1841 , the Second Court House , on Grant 's Hill , was completed . Made from polished gray sandstone , the court house had a rotunda 60 feet ( 18 m ) in diameter and 80 feet ( 24 m ) high . [ 33 ] Great Fire of Pittsburgh , 1845 Like many burgeoning cities of its day , Pittsburgh 's growth outstripped some of its necessary infrastructure , such as a water supply with dependable pressure . [ 34 ] Because of this , on April 10 , 1845 , a great fire burned out of control , destroying over a thousand buildings and causing $ 9M in damages . [ 31 ] As the city rebuilt , the age of rails arrived . In 1851 , the Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad began service between Cleveland and Allegheny City ( present-day North Side ) . [ 27 ] In 1854 , the Pennsylvania Railroad began service between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia . Despite many challenges , Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial powerhouse . An 1857 article provided a snapshot of the Iron City : [ 31 ] 939 factories in Pittsburgh and Allegheny City employing more than 10K workers producing almost $ 12M in goods using 400 steam engines Total coal consumed — 22M bushels Total iron consumed — 127K tons In steam tonnage , third busiest port in the nation , surpassed only by New York City and New Orleans .

Scots Irish leadership [ edit ] Ingham ( 1978 ) examined the leadership of the industry in its most important center , Pittsburgh , as well as smaller cities . He concludes that the leadership of the iron and steel industry nationwide was `` largely Scotch Irish '' . Ingham finds that the Scotch Irish held together cohesively throughout the 19th century and `` developed their own sense of uniqueness . '' [ 36 ] New immigrants after 1800 made Pittsburgh a major Scotch-Irish stronghold . For example , Thomas Mellon ( b. Ulster 1813–1908 ) left northern Ireland in 1823 for the United States . He founded the powerful Mellon family , which played a central role in banking and industries such as aluminum and oil . As Barnhisel ( 2005 ) finds , industrialists such as James Laughlin ( b. Ulster 1806–1882 ) of Jones and Laughlin Steel Company comprised the `` Scots-Irish Presbyterian ruling stratum of Pittsburgh society . '' [ 37 ] Technology [ edit ] In 1859 , the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced coke -fire smelting to the region . The American Civil War boosted the city 's economy with increased production of iron and armaments , especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry . [ 33 ] Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world 's first 21 '' gun . [ 38 ] By war 's end , over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh . A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875 , when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process . [ 39 ] Industrialists such as Andrew Carnegie , Henry Clay Frick , Andrew W. Mellon , and Charles M. Schwab built their fortunes in Pittsburgh . Also based in Pittsburgh was George Westinghouse , credited with such advancements as the air brake and founder of over 60 companies , including Westinghouse Air and Brake Company ( 1869 ) , Union Switch & Signal ( 1881 ) , and Westinghouse Electric Company ( 1886 ) . [ 40 ] Banks played a key role in Pittsburgh 's development as these industrialists sought massive loans to upgrade plants , integrate industries and fund technological advances . For example , T. Mellon & Sons Bank , founded in 1869 , helped to finance an aluminum reduction company that became Alcoa . [ 39 ] Ingham ( 1991 ) shows how small , independent iron and steel manufacturers survived and prospered from the 1870s through the 1950s , despite competition from much larger , standardized production firms . These smaller firms were built on a culture that valued local markets and the beneficial role of business in the local community . Small firms concentrated on specialized products , particularly structural steel , where the economies of scale of larger firms were no advantage . They embraced technological change more cautiously than larger firms . They also had less antagonistic relations with workers and employed a higher percentage of highly skilled workers than their mass-production counterparts . [ 41 ] Geography of industrialization [ edit ] Beginning in the 1870s , entrepreneurs transformed the economy from small , craft-organized factories located inside the city limits to a large integrated industrial region stretching 50 miles across Allegheny County . The new industrial Pittsburgh was based on integrated mills , mass production , and modern management organization in steel and other industries . Many manufacturers searched for large sites with railroad and river accessibility . They purchased land , designed modern plants , and sometimes built towns for workers . Other firms bought into new communities that began as speculative industrial real estate ventures . Some owners removed their plants from the central city 's labor unions to exert greater control over workers . The region 's rugged topography and dispersed natural resources of coal and gas accentuated this dispersal . The rapid growth of steel , glass , railroad equipment , and coke industries resulted in both large mass-production plants and numerous smaller firms . As capital deepened and interdependence grew , participants multiplied , economies accrued , the division of labor increased , and localized production systems formed around these industries . Transportation , capital , labor markets , and the division of labor in production bound the scattered industrial plants and communities into a sprawling metropolitan district . By 1910 the Pittsburgh district was a complex urban landscape with a dominant central city , surrounded by proximate residential communities , mill towns , satellite cities , and hundreds of mining towns . [ 42 ] Representative of the new industrial suburbs was the model town of Vandergrift , according to Mosher ( 1995 ) . Caught up in a dramatic round of industrial restructuring and labor tension , Pittsburgh steelmaker George McMurtry hired Frederick Law Olmsted 's landscape architectural firm in 1895 to design Vandergrift as a model town . McMurtry believed in what was later known as welfare capitalism , with the company going beyond paychecks to provide for the social needs of the workers ; he believed that a benign physical environment made for happier and more productive workers . A strike and lockout at McMurtry 's steelworks in Apollo , Pennsylvania , prompted him to build the new town . Wanting a loyal workforce , he developed a town agenda that drew upon environmentalism as well as popular attitudes toward capital 's treatment of labor . The Olmsted firm translated this agenda into an urban design that included a unique combination of social reform , comprehensive infrastructure planning , and private homeownership principles . The rates of homeownership and cordial relationships between the steel company and Vandergrift residents fostered loyalty among McMurtry 's skilled workers and led to McMurtry 's greatest success . In 1901 he used Vandergrift 's worker-residents to break the first major strike against the United States Steel Corporation . [ 43 ] Machine politics [ edit ] Christopher Magee and William Flinn operated powerful Republican machines that controlled local politics after 1880 . They were business owners and favored business interests . Flinn was a leader of the Progressive movement statewide and supported Theodore Roosevelt in the 1912 election . [ 44 ] Germans [ edit ] During the mid-19th century , Pittsburgh witnessed a dramatic influx of German immigrants , including a brick mason whose son , Henry J. Heinz , founded the H.J . Heinz Company in 1869 . Heinz was at the forefront of reform efforts to improve food purity , working conditions , hours , and wages , [ 45 ] but the company bitterly opposed the formation of an independent labor union . [ 46 ] Labor unions [ edit ] As a manufacturing center , Pittsburgh also became an arena for intense labor strife . During the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 , Pittsburgh workers protested and had massive demonstrations that erupted into widespread violence , known as the Pittsburgh Railway Riots . [ 47 ] Militia and federal troops were called to the city to suppress the strike . Forty men died , most of them workers , and more than 40 buildings were burned down , including the Union Depot of the Pennsylvania Railroad . Strikers also burned and destroyed rolling stock : more than 100 train engines and 1000 railcars were destroyed . It was the city with the most violence of any affected by the strikes . Burning of Pennsylvania Railroad and Union Depot , Pittsburgh , July 21–22 , 1877 In 1892 , a confrontation in the steel industry resulted in 10 deaths ( 3 detectives , 7 workers ) when Carnegie Steel Company 's manager Henry Clay Frick sent in Pinkertons to break the Homestead Strike . Labor strife continued into the years of the Great Depression , as workers sought to protect their jobs and improve working conditions . Unions organized H.J . Heinz workers , with the assistance of the Catholic Radical Alliance . Carnegie [ edit ] Andrew Carnegie , an
