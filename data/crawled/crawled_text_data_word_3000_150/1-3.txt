Liberty was also included in Renaissance I Urban Renewal plans , with over 125 acres ( 0.51 km 2 ) of the neighborhood being demolished and replaced with garden apartments , three 20-story public housing apartments , and a convoluted road-way system that circled a pedestrianized shopping district . In the span of just a few years during the mid-1960s , East Liberty became a blighted neighborhood . There were some 575 businesses in East Liberty in 1959 , but only 292 in 1970 , and just 98 in 1979 . Preservation efforts by the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation , along with community neighborhood groups , resisted the demolition plans . The neighborhoods containing rich architectural heritage , including the Mexican War Streets , Allegheny West , and Manchester , were spared . The center of Allegheny City , with its culturally and socially important buildings , was not as lucky . All of the buildings , with the exception of the Old U.S. Post Office , the Carnegie Library , and Buhl Planetarium were destroyed and replaced with the `` pedestrianized '' Allegheny Center Mall and apartments . The city 's industrial base continued to grow in the post-war era [ 74 ] partly assisted by the area 's first agency entirely devoted to industrial development , the RIDC . [ 75 ] [ 76 ] Jones and Laughlin Steel Company expanded its plant on the Southside . H.J . Heinz , Pittsburgh Plate Glass , Alcoa , Westinghouse , U.S. Steel and its new division , the Pittsburgh Chemical Company and many other companies also continued robust operations through the 1960s . [ 11 ] 1970 marked the completion of the final building projects of Renaissance I : the U.S. Steel Tower and Three Rivers Stadium . [ 27 ] In 1974 , with the addition of the fountain at the tip of the Golden Triangle , Point State Park was completed . [ 77 ] Although air quality was dramatically improved , and Pittsburgh 's manufacturing base seemed solid , questions abound about the negative effects Urban Renewal continues to have on the social fabric of Pittsburgh . Pittsburgh , however , was about to undergo one of its most dramatic transformations . Like most major cities , Pittsburgh experienced several days of rioting following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in April 1968 . There were no further major riots , although tension remained high in the inner-city black neighborhoods . [ 78 ] Reinvention ( 1973–present ) [ edit ] Downtown Pittsburgh in July 1974 A similar picture of Downtown Pittsburgh from Mt . Washington in December 2005 During the 1970s and 1980s , the U.S. steel industry came under increasing pressure from foreign competition and from American mini-mills constructed inexpensively using salvaged steel . [ citation needed ] Manufacture in Germany and Japan was booming . Foreign mills and factories , built with the latest technology , benefited from lower labor costs and powerful government-corporate partnerships , allowing them to capture increasing market shares of steel and steel products . Separately , demand for steel softened due to recessions , the 1973 oil crisis , and increasing use of other materials . [ 11 ] [ 79 ] The era began with the RIDC 's `` Building on Basics '' report in 1974 . [ 80 ] Collapse of steel [ edit ] Further information : Steel crisis Free market pressures exposed the U.S. steel industry 's own internal problems , which included a now-outdated manufacturing base that had been over-expanded in the 1950s and 1960s , hostile management and labor relationships , the inflexibility of United Steelworkers regarding wage cuts and work-rule reforms , oligarchic management styles , and poor strategic planning by both unions and management . In particular , Pittsburgh faced its own challenges . Local coke and iron ore deposits were depleted , raising material costs . The large mills in the Pittsburgh region also faced competition from newer , more profitable `` mini-mills '' and non-union mills with lower labor costs . [ 79 ] Beginning in the late 1970s and early 1980s , the steel industry in Pittsburgh began to implode along with the deindustrialization of the U.S. [ 81 ] Following the 1981–1982 recession , for example , the mills laid off 153,000 workers . [ 79 ] The steel mills began to shut down . These closures caused a ripple effect , as railroads , mines , and other factories across the region lost business and closed . [ 82 ] [ 83 ] The local economy suffered a depression , marked by high unemployment and underemployment , as laid-off workers took lower-paying , non-union jobs . [ 84 ] Pittsburgh suffered as elsewhere in the Rust Belt with a declining population , and like many other U.S. cities , it also saw white flight to the suburbs . [ 85 ] In 1991 the Homestead Works was demolished , replaced in 1999 by The Waterfront shopping mall . As a direct result of the loss of mill employment , the number of people living in Homestead dwindled . By the time of the 2000 census , the borough population was 3,569 . The borough began financially recovering in 2002 , with the enlarging retail tax base . Corporations [ edit ] Top corporate headquarters such as Gulf Oil ( 1985 ) , Koppers ( 1987 ) , Westinghouse ( 1996 ) and Rockwell International ( 1989 ) were bought out by larger firms , with the loss of high paying , white collar headquarters and research personnel ( the `` brain drain '' ) as well as massive charitable contributions by the `` home based '' companies to local cultural and educational institutions . At the time of the Gulf Oil merger in 1985 it was the largest buyout in world history involving the company that was No . 7 on the Fortune 500 just six years earlier . Over 1,000 high paying white collar corporate and PhD research jobs were lost in one day . Today , there are no steel mills within the city limits of Pittsburgh , although manufacture continues at regional mills , such as the Edgar Thomson Works in nearby Braddock . Higher education [ edit ] Pittsburgh is home to three universities that are included in most under-graduate and graduate school national rankings , The University of Pittsburgh , Carnegie Mellon University and Duquesne University . Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh had evolved in the mid-20th century along lines that followed the needs of the heavy industries that financed and directed their development . The collapse of steel put pressure on those two universities to reinvent themselves as research centers in science and technology which acted to pull the regional economy toward high-technology fields . [ 86 ] Other regional collegiate institutions include Robert Morris University , Chatham University , Carlow University , Point Park University , La Roche College , Pittsburgh Theological Seminary , Trinity School for Ministry ( an Episcopal seminary ) and the Community College of Allegheny County . Beginning in the 1980s , Pittsburgh 's economy shifted from heavy industry to services , medicine , higher education , tourism , banking , corporate headquarters , and high technology . Today , the top two private employers in the city are the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center ( 26,000 employees ) and the West Penn Allegheny Health System ( 13,000 employees ) . [ 87 ] [ 88 ] Civic improvements [ edit ] Despite the economic turmoil , civic improvements continued . In the mid-1970s , Arthur P. Ziegler , Jr. and the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation ( Landmarks ) wanted to demonstrate that historic preservation could be used to drive economic development without the use of eminent domain or public subsidies . Landmarks acquired the former terminal buildings and yards of the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad , a 1-mile ( 1.6 km ) long property at the base of Mt . Washington facing the City of Pittsburgh . In 1976 , Landmarks developed the site as a mixed-use historic adaptive reuse development that gave the foundation the opportunity to put its urban planning principles into practice . Aided by an initial generous gift from the Allegheny Foundation in 1976 , Landmarks adapted five historic Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad buildings for new uses and added a hotel , a dock for the Gateway Clipper fleet , and parking areas . Now shops , offices , restaurants , and entertainment anchor the historic riverfront site on the south shore of the Monongahela River , opposite the Golden Triangle ( Pittsburgh ) . Station Square is Pittsburgh 's premier attraction , generating over 3,500,000 visitors a year . It reflects a $ 100 million investment from all sources , with the lowest public cost and highest taxpayer return of any major renewal project in the Pittsburgh region since the 1950s . In 1994 , Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation sold Station Square in to Forest City Enterprises which created an endowment to help support its restoration efforts and educational programs . Each year the staff and docents of Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation introduce more than 10,000 people – teachers , students , adults , and visitors – to the architectural heritage of the Pittsburgh region and to the value of historic preservation . [ 89 ] During this period , Pittsburgh also became a national model for community development , through the work of activists such as Dorothy Mae Richardson , who founded Neighborhood Housing Services in 1968 , an organization that became the model for the nationwide NeighborWorks America . Activists such a Richardson shared the aim of Landmarks to rehabilitate Pittsburgh 's existing built landscape rather than to demolish and redevelop . In 1985 , the J & L Steel site on the north side of the Monongahela river was cleared and a publicly subsidized High Technology Center was built . The Pittsburgh Technology Center , home to many major technology companies , is planning major expansion in the area soon . [ 27 ] In the 1980s , the `` Renaissance II '' urban revitalization created numerous new structures , such as PPG Place . In the 1990s , the former sites of the Homestead , Duquesne and South Side J & L mills were cleared . [ 27 ] In 1992 , the new terminal at Pittsburgh International Airport opened . [ 27 ] In 2001 , the aging Three Rivers Stadium was replaced by Heinz Field and PNC Park , despite being rejected by voter referendum . In 2010 , PPG Paints Arena , replaced the Civic Arena , which at the time was the oldest arena in the National Hockey League . [ 90 ] Also in 1985 , Al Michaels revealed to a national TV audience how Pittsburgh had transformed itself from an industrial rust belt city . [ 91 ] Pittsburgh today [ edit ] Present-day Pittsburgh , with a diversified economy , a low cost of living , and a rich infrastructure for medicine and education and culture , has been ranked as one of the World 's Most Livable Cities . [ 92 ] Tourism has recently boomed in Pittsburgh with nearly 3,000 new hotel rooms opening since 2004 and holding a consistently higher occupancy than in comparable cities . Medicine has replaced steel as a leading industry . [ 93 ] Meanwhile , tech giants such as Apple , Google , IBM Watson , Facebook , and Intel have joined the 1,600 technology firms choosing to operate out of Pittsburgh . As a result of the proximity to CMU 's National Robotics Engineering Center ( NREC ) , there has a boom of autonomous vehicles companies . The region has also become a leader in green environmental design , a movement exemplified by the city 's convention center . In the last twenty years the region has seen a small but influential group of Asian immigrants , including from the Indian sub-continent . It has been generally considered as the most recovered city from the rust belt .
