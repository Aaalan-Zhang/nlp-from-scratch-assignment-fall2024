Washington The economy of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania is diversified , focused on services , medicine , higher education , tourism , banking , corporate headquarters and high technology . Once the center of the American steel industry , and still known as `` The Steel City `` , today the city of Pittsburgh has no steel mills within its limits , though Pittsburgh-based companies such as US Steel , Ampco Pittsburgh and Allegheny Technologies own several working mills in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area . Pittsburgh was chosen for the 2009 G-20 summit as its transformation is an example of a 21st-century economy . On September 8 , 2009 , President Barack Obama stated , `` Pittsburgh stands as a bold example of how to create new jobs and industries while transitioning to a 21st century economy . '' [ 1 ] On the list of best cities for job growth in 2009 , created by Tara Weiss , a writer for Forbes magazine , Pittsburgh secured its spot because of its strength in the health care and education industries with healthy foundations in technology or robotics and banking industries . [ 2 ] The 2009 list of all cities places Pittsburgh as the 169th-best city for job growth . [ 3 ] Pittsburgh has also ranked in the top five most livable cities in four of the seven multi-year rankings of Places Rated Almanac ( 1983 , 1985 , 1989 , and 2007 ) . [ 4 ] History [ edit ] Main article : History of Pittsburgh Early foundation [ edit ] Early look at Pittsburgh During the mid-18th century , the economy of the Pittsburgh region was focused on agriculture and trade . After the American Revolutionary War , the government placed a tax on whiskey in order to pay off national debt . In 1794 , the Whiskey Rebellion occurred in Pittsburgh and was the first challenge to the government. “ The fledgling Federal government had decided to levy its first tax against whiskey , but the farmers argued they did n't have cash to pay taxes on bartered goods , and marched in protest . Washington had to send troops to squelch the protest and enforce the tax laws. ” [ 5 ] During the 18th century , large coal deposits were discovered throughout Pittsburgh . Mount Washington , originally called `` Coal Hill '' , the “ most valuable deposit of bituminous coal in the entire United States , was discovered there in 1760 ” . [ 6 ] Along with the natural resources of the area , Pittsburgh was located at the intersection of the Monongahela , Ohio , and Allegheny Rivers , that is , along the major trade routes of the United States , thus making Pittsburgh `` one of the world 's leading industrial powerhouses '' . “ The first and largest industry emerging in the 1800s was boat building—both flatboats to transport waves of pioneers and goods downriver , and keelboats , which a strong crew could propel upstream as well. ” [ 5 ] The second biggest industry in the region was glass production . The first glass factory was built in 1795 by James O'Hara and Isaac Craig . [ 5 ] Nineteenth century [ edit ] Pittsburgh ’ s wealthiest industrialists during the 19th century all lived in a single neighborhood known as East Liberty . The major list of industrialists includes H. J. Heinz , George Westinghouse , Andrew Carnegie , Thomas Mellon , Andrew Mellon , Henry Clay Frick and Philander Knox . All of these men shared similar ideas in the system of capitalism and utilized their skills to net the world ’ s highest income per capita during the 19th century in this single neighborhood . [ 7 ] Andrew Carnegie was also known as a philanthropist to the region . “ In 1889 he wrote `` The Gospel of Wealth `` , in which he asserted that all personal wealth beyond that required to supply the needs of one 's family should be regarded as a trust fund to be administered for the benefit of the community ” . [ 8 ] Subsequently , the Carnegie Library , which is free to the public , opened in Pittsburgh in 1890 and is still open presently . [ 9 ] Overall , Carnegie donated over $ 350 million for the establishment of organizations that benefit the public . [ 8 ] Wealthy industrialists founded the Duquesne Club in 1873 and the Greater Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce in 1874 . The Pittsburgh Stock Exchange was also formed in 1864 as the `` Oil Exchange '' before becoming the `` Coal Exchange '' in 1870 and then back to the `` Oil Exchange '' in 1878 until opening for all general stocks by 1894 . The stock exchange closed its Fourth Avenue `` financial district '' doors in August 1974 after computerization had consolidated trades in New York , Chicago and other global centers but not before a 1966 response from the New York Stock Exchange board of possibly relocating their trading floor to the city 's facilities . [ 10 ] Railroad networks reached the Pittsburgh area in the mid-19th century . The Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad opened in 1851 , which allowed passengers to travel through Allegheny and New Brighton while the Pennsylvania Railroad established `` Pittsburgh service '' as close as Turtle Creek from their Philadelphia hub that same year . A year later , in 1852 , the Pennsylvania Railroad was completed to Downtown Pittsburgh . In 1856 , the Allegheny Valley Railroad was built . [ 9 ] [ 11 ] Andrew Carnegie was one of the first to capitalize on the railways ; in 1865 he founded the Pittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works which would be an industry leader from the city until 1919 . In 1892 , the economy of Pittsburgh faced the Homestead Strike between the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers and the Carnegie Steel Company . After the workers ' previous wage contract expired in 1892 , and a new negotiation was not reached , a violent conflict ensued leaving several dead and wounded . Ultimately , The Carnegie Steel company won and had avoided union formation in Pittsburgh . [ 12 ] Emergence of `` Big Steel '' [ edit ] After Carnegie Steel was reorganized as U.S. Steel in 1901 , it and J & L Steel dominated the local economy . Several secondary players contributed to the capacity of the metro area such as Cyclops Steel in Bridgeville , Pennsylvania from 1908 until 1987 , Mesta Machinery in West Homestead , Pennsylvania from 1898 until 1983 , Dravo Corporation at Neville Island , Pennsylvania until 1984 , [ 13 ] National Steel Corporation until 1992 , Wean United as an independent until 1993 ( still maintaining US headquarters in the city ) , Harbison Walker Refactories as an independent until 1967 ( while still maintaining US headquarters in the city ) and the still operational Allegheny Technologies and Ampco Pittsburgh . Bethlehem Steel , Republic Steel and LTV Steel also had large local operations . Other major mills of the area included : McKeesport Tube Works 1872–1987 [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Edgar Thomson Steel Works 1873–present Hays Army Ammunition Plant 1942-June 1971 Clairton Steel Works April 21 , 1903 [ 16 ] -1984 [ 17 ] Duquesne Steel Works 1886 – October 1 , 1984 , employed as many as 9,000 persons in the 1940s . [ 18 ] [ 19 ] Homestead Steel Works 1881-May 24 , 1986 [ 20 ] [ 21 ] Carrie Furnace 1884–1982 Saxonburg Mill -1987 [ 15 ] Verona Mill April 4 , 1905- ( two 20-gross-ton Symthe acid open hearth furnaces ) ( 14,400 tons annually ) Mon Valley Works – Irvin Plant 1938–present Midland Cyclops Steel Plant until October 15 , 1982 [ 22 ] McKees Rocks , Pennsylvania Wheel and Axel plant ( Lockhart Iron and Steel and Pressed Steel Car Corp. ) Pressed Steel had as many as 12,000 employees . [ 23 ] Donora US Steel Wire mill -1966 4,500 employees [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] Monessen American Chain & Cable -1972 1,000 employees . [ 24 ] East Monongahela Liggett Spring & Axle -1978 350 employees . [ 24 ] McKeesport Ft. Pitt Steel Casting -1978 325 employees . [ 24 ] Hazelwood J & L Steel -1981 1,000 employees . [ 24 ] Glassport Bucyrus-Erie -1981 430 employees . [ 24 ] West Homestead Mesta Machinery -1981 300 employees . [ 24 ] West Mifflin Continental Can -1982 265 employees . [ 24 ] Alcoa 's New Kensington works 1893-March 1971 at its peak employed 3,300 workers on 75 acres under 1 million square feet of manufacturing space . [ 27 ] Alcoa 's Logan Ferry Powder Works 1918– ? Alcoa 's Coal Mine ( north of New Kensington ) 1918–1923 [ 27 ] Carnegie 's Union Railroad was founded in 1894 and is still in operation serving area steel mills . Twentieth century [ edit ] Pittsburgh Steel mill in Homestead circa 1907 In the early 20th century the economy of Pittsburgh was primarily driven by the steel industry and the city had reached a population 321,616 . [ 28 ] Throughout this period , Pittsburgh would see a spike in population and a slow decline at the end of the century . At one point Pittsburgh was the eighth-largest city in America . [ citation needed ] In 1901 , The Amalgamated Association of Iron , Steel and Tin Workers organized a general strike against the U.S. Steel Corporation subsidiaries , the first strike since 1892 . [ 29 ] A 1903 Pittsburgh Press front page highlighted the city 's being a focus point for three different railroads . [ 30 ] In 1911 the city was being referred to as the `` Stogie capital of the nation '' with several high quality cigar manufacturers located in the region . [ 31 ] Pittsburgh produced around one third of the national output of steel by the 1920s . During this period Pittsburgh was home to the world 's largest tube and pipe mill , structural steel plant , rail mill , wire manufacturing plant , bridge and construction fabricating plant . [ 32 ] `` Boat building and metal industries were later the economic base of the region . When coke from coal began to replace charcoal from wood in iron and steel making Pittsburgh grew up as the heart of the industry . A plentiful supply of bituminous coal underlies the Pittsburgh area . '' [ 33 ] Around forty percent of the nation 's coal was obtained from within 100 miles of Pittsburgh . [ 32 ] Due to the reforms of Franklin Roosevelt 's New Deal , steel unions gained success in Pittsburgh . The Wagner Act of 1935 gave employees rights to self-organize in labor unions and made it unlawful for employers to prevent or interfere with such unions . [ 34 ] By the 1950s industrial leaders worked with regional government leaders to foster and retain more local industry ; organizations such as the RIDC were formed to further this goal . [ 35 ] [ 36 ] However , in the early to mid-1980s the steel industry collapsed , leaving half of the nation 's steelworkers unemployed . [ 37 ] `` The number of steel workers in the Pittsburgh area dropped from 90,000 in 1980 to 44,000 in just four years '' . [ 38 ] Motor Coils manufacturing company of suburban Forest Hills and Braddock has been a leading supplier to American railroads since 1957 . [ 39 ] Pittsburgh was a major center for advertising and public relations firms in the 20th century such as Ketchum and Burson-Marsteller . [ 40 ] Retail chains such as G. C. Murphy , Thrift Drug , Thorofare , Fisher 's Big Wheel and Giant Eagle were founded in the early part of the 20th century with Phar-Mor dominating local retail from the 1980s to the 2000s . Thorofare ceased operations in 1982 and Thrift Drug was bought out by Eckerd in 1996 . Local stores of Loblaws closed in 1958 , Kroger in 1966 ( although it retains stores in nearby West Virginia counties ) and A & P in 1972 . [ 41 ] IGA closed its area stores in the early 2000s . [ 42 ] Transition into the present economy [ edit ] Within the transitional years between 1970 and 1990 , Pittsburgh 's Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area saw shifts in its main employers , which were the manufacturing sector . In 1970 , one out of every three jobs was in the manufacturing sector . By 1980 this had slipped to one in four . In 1980 , the average production worker in manufacturing was making $ 360.89 weekly , which was almost $ 70 more than the state and national average . During this period the largest group of occupational employment was blue collar . This group in 1980 accounted for almost 68 percent of the jobs market . In the 1980s , a decline in the manufacturing industry was expected . The accepted trend was that Pittsburgh would embrace “ industrial robots ” . Since 1955 Pittsburgh has seen a steady decline in manufacturing employment . In 1955 Pittsburgh had a population of 41.8 percent in the manufactory business . In 1980 that number had slipped to almost 25.3 percent . [ 43 ] Allegheny County is the center for health care and higher education employment . Higher education and health care were the biggest creators of high-wage [ clarification needed ] jobs in the Pittsburgh region between 1999 and 2005 . Education accounts for almost 80 % of high-wage jobs in Allegheny County . The Pittsburgh area has seen growth in other sectors as well . Professional services , finance and wholesale trade were among the growing sectors . However , much of this growth was outside the borders of Allegheny County . This was detrimental to the county of Allegheny ; however , the growth in the outer nine counties helped to stabilize the loss of employment . With big events happening in Pittsburgh throughout the late 2000s , the tourism industry has flourished . The industry has created over 11,000 new jobs in the area , some 6,000 of them within Allegheny County . [ 44 ] Pittsburgh has long been a major finance and banking center . [ 45 ] Present situation [ edit ] Since 2009 Pittsburgh has hosted the annual DUG East Conference . [ 46 ] [ 47 ] `` Total nonfarm employment , over-the-year percent change in the United States and the Pittsburgh metropolitan area , March 1999-2009 '' [ 48 ] The following is a list of the top ten private employers in Pittsburgh . [ 49 ] Rank Employer Number of Pittsburgh employees Product ( s ) 1 University of Pittsburgh Medical Center 40,600 Health care 2 University of Pittsburgh 12,600 Higher education 3 PNC Financial Services 9,200 Financial services 4 Allegheny Health Network 8,900 Health care 5 Giant Eagle 8,000 Supermarkets 6 Bank of New York Mellon 7,610 Financial services 7 Highmark 5,270 Health insurance 8 U.S. Steel 4,700 Steel manufacturing 9 Carnegie Mellon University 4,600 Higher education 10 Verizon Communications 3,750 Telecommunications Pittsburgh saw fewer effects of the 2008 economic recession than many other American cities . The city 's transition from heavy dependence on the manufacturing industries to an economy based on health services , education , and innovative technologies kept Pittsburgh from the worst of the recession . The housing industry never saw the over-inflation rates other regions were dealing with as housing prices rose two percent in the last quarter of 2008 , while other cities in the nation saw a much higher decline percentage . [ 50 ] In the period between 2006 and 2011 , the Pittsburgh MSA experienced over 10 % appreciation in housing prices—the highest appreciation out of the largest 25 MSAs in the United States . 22 of the top 25 MSAs saw a depreciation of housing values during the same period . [ 51 ] National non-profits [ edit ] Several national or global non-profits call Pittsburgh home including : Learning Disabilities Association of America ( since 1963 ) [ 52 ] Institute for Research , Education and Training in Addictions [ 53 ] National Center for Juvenile Justice ( since 1973 ) [ 54 ] Colcom Foundation ( since 1996 ) Laurel Foundation ( since 1951 ) Heinz Endowments Printing Industries of America ( since 2003 ) Twenty-first-century progression [ edit ] The shifting economy of Pittsburgh has seen changes since the 1990s ; these are primarily in banking , health care and technology . However , In December 2004 , Pittsburgh was forced into an Act 47 because the finances in the city were down . In January 2003 Pittsburgh 's unemployment rate reached 6.8 % , but has seen a major decline in , as in April 2005 the rates were near only 4.8 % . [ 55 ] Since one in every five jobs in Pittsburgh lies within the health care service , Pittsburgh was able to hold steady during
