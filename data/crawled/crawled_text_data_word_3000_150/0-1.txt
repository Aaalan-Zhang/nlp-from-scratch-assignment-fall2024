became a city . It was served by numerous river steamboats that increased trading traffic on the rivers . In the 1830s , many Welsh people from the Merthyr steelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the Merthyr Rising . By the 1840s , Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains . The Great Fire of Pittsburgh destroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845 . The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape the Great Famine . By 1857 , Pittsburgh 's 1,000 factories were consuming 22 million coal bushels yearly . Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area , with the most coming from Germany . Because Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution , enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South , or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city . There were active stations of the Underground Railroad in the city , and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and African-American workers in city hotels . The Drennen Slave Girl walked out of the Monongahela House in 1850 , apparently to freedom . [ 40 ] The Merchant 's Hotel was also a place where African-American workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the Underground Railroad . [ 41 ] Sometimes refugee slaves from the South stayed in Pittsburgh , but other times they continued North , including into Canada . Many slaves left the city and county for Canada after Congress passed the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act , as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties . From 1850 to 1860 , the black population in Allegheny County dropped from 3,431 to 2,725 as people headed to more safety in Canada . [ 40 ] The American Civil War boosted the city 's economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union . Andrew Carnegie began steel production in 1875 at the Edgar Thomson Steel Works in North Braddock , Pennsylvania , which evolved into the Carnegie Steel Company . He adopted the Bessemer process to increase production . Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region . Railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers , increasing transportation access to important markets . 20th century [ edit ] An aerial view of Pittsburgh in 1902 [ 42 ] Steel mills in the Strip District in 1906 In 1901 , J. P. Morgan and attorney Elbert H. Gary merged Carnegie Steel Company and several other companies into U.S. Steel . By 1910 , Pittsburgh was the nation 's eighth-largest city , accounting for between one-third and one-half of national steel output . The Pittsburgh Agreement was subscribed in May 1918 between the Czech and Slovak nationalities , as envisioned by T. G. Masaryk , concerning the future foundation of Czechoslovakia . [ 43 ] The city suffered severe flooding in March 1936 . The city 's population swelled to more than a half million , attracting numerous European immigrants to its industrial jobs . By 1940 , non-Hispanic whites were 90.6 % of the city 's population . [ 44 ] Pittsburgh also became a main destination of the African-American Great Migration from the rural South during the first half of the 20th century . [ 45 ] Limited initially by discrimination , some 95 % percent of the men became unskilled steel workers . [ 46 ] During World War II , demand for steel increased and area mills operated 24 hours a day to produce 95 million tons of steel for the war effort . [ 29 ] This resulted in the highest levels of air pollution in the city 's almost century of industry . The city 's reputation as the `` arsenal of democracy '' [ 47 ] [ 48 ] was being overshadowed by James Parton 's 1868 observation of Pittsburgh being `` hell with the lid off . '' [ 49 ] Following World War II , the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the `` Renaissance , '' cleaning up the air and the rivers . The `` Renaissance II '' project followed in 1977 , focused on cultural and neighborhood development . The industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s , but beginning in the early 1980s both the area 's steel and electronics industries imploded during national industrial restructuring . There were massive layoffs from mill and plant closures . [ 11 ] In the later 20th century , the area shifted its economic base to education , tourism , and services , largely based on healthcare/medicine , finance , and high technology such as robotics . Although Pittsburgh successfully shifted its economy and remained viable , the city 's population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs . While 680,000 people lived in the city proper in 1950 , a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence resulted in a decrease in city population , even as the metropolitan area population increased again . 21st century [ edit ] During the late 2000s recession , Pittsburgh was economically strong , adding jobs when most cities were losing them . It was one of the few cities in the United States to see housing property values rise . Between 2006 and 2011 , the Pittsburgh metropolitan statistical area ( MSA ) experienced over 10 % appreciation in housing prices , the highest appreciation of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States , with 22 of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas experiencing depreciations in housing values . [ 50 ] In September 2009 , the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit was held in Pittsburgh .

Starting in the late 20th century , the city undertook a Main Street program in cooperation with the National Trust for Historic Preservation , encouraging design and landscape improvements on East Carson Street , and supporting new retail . The area has become a local Pittsburgher destination , and the value of homes in the South Side had increased in value by about 10 % annually for the 10 years leading up to 2014 . [ 60 ] East Carson Street has developed as one of the most vibrant areas of the city , packed with diverse shopping , ethnic eateries , vibrant nightlife , and live music venues . In 1993 , the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh purchased the South Side Works steel mill property . It collaborated with the community and various developers to create a master plan for a mixed-use development that included a riverfront park , office space , housing , health-care facilities , and indoor practice fields for the Pittsburgh Steelers and Pitt Panthers . Construction of the development began in 1998 . The SouthSide Works has been open since 2005 , featuring many stores , restaurants , offices , and the world headquarters for American Eagle Outfitters .

Summers are hot and winters are moderately cold with wide variations in temperature . Despite this , it has one of the most pleasant summer climates between medium and large cities in the U.S. [ 71 ] [ 72 ] [ 73 ] The city lies in the USDA plant hardiness zone 6b except along the rivers where the zone is 7a . [ 74 ] The area has four distinct seasons : winters are cold and snowy , springs and falls are mild with moderate levels of sunshine , and summers are warm . As measured by percent possible sunshine , summer is by far the sunniest season , though annual sunshine is low among major US cities at well under 50 % . [ 75 ] The warmest month of the year in Pittsburgh is July , with a 24-hour average of 73.2 ยฐF ( 22.9 ยฐC ) . Conditions are often humid , and combined with highs reaching 90 ยฐF ( 32 ยฐC ) on an average 9.5 days a year , [ 76 ] a considerable heat index arises .
