Sports in Pittsburgh have been played dating back to the American Civil War . Baseball , hockey , and the first professional American football game had been played in the city by 1892 . Pittsburgh was first known as the `` City of Champions '' when the Pittsburgh Pirates , Pittsburgh Panthers football team , and Pittsburgh Steelers won multiple championships in the 1970s . [ 1 ] Today , the city has three major professional sports franchises , the Pirates , Steelers , and Penguins ; while the University of Pittsburgh Panthers compete in a Division I Power Five conference , the highest level of collegiate athletics in the United States , in both football and basketball . Local universities Duquesne and Robert Morris also field Division I teams in men 's and women 's basketball and Division I FCS teams in football . Robert Morris also fields Division I men 's and women 's ice hockey teams . Pittsburgh 's major teams have seen great success , with the MLB 's Pirates winning 5 World Series titles , the NHL 's Penguins winning 5 Stanley Cups , and the NFL 's Steelers winning a tied league record 6 Super Bowls . The Pittsburgh Panthers have also been successful in the NCAA with 9 national championships in football and 2 in basketball . The flag of Pittsburgh is colored with black and gold , based on the colors of William Pitt 's coat of arms ; Pittsburgh is the only city in the United States in which all professional sporting teams share the same colors . The city 's first National Hockey League ( NHL ) franchise , the Pittsburgh Pirates , and that team 's non-NHL predecessor , the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets , wore black and gold as their colors in the 1920s . The colors were adopted by founder of the Pittsburgh Steelers , Art Rooney , in 1933 . In 1948 , the Pittsburgh baseball Pirates switched their colors from red and blue to black and gold . Pittsburgh 's second NHL franchise , the Pittsburgh Penguins , wore blue and white , due to then-general manager Jack Riley 's upbringing in Ontario . In 1979 , after the Steelers and Pirates had each won their respective league championships , the Penguins altered their color scheme to match , despite objections from the Boston Bruins , [ 2 ] [ 3 ] who have used the black and gold combination since the 1935–36 NHL season . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] In 1975 , late Steelers radio broadcaster Myron Cope invented the Terrible Towel , which has become `` arguably the best-known fan symbol of any major pro sports team . '' [ 6 ] Cope was one of multiple sports figures born in Pittsburgh and its surrounding area ; others include golfer Arnold Palmer , Olympian Kurt Angle , and basketball player Jack Twyman . Pittsburgh is also sometimes called the `` Cradle of Quarterbacks '' [ 7 ] [ 8 ] due to the number of prominent players of that position who hail from the area , including NFL greats Jim Kelly , George Blanda , Johnny Unitas , Joe Namath , Dan Marino , and Joe Montana . The hometown Pittsburgh Penguins NHL ice hockey team defeats the Washington Capitals in Game 7 of the 2017 Stanley Cup playoffs second round en route to winning the Stanley Cup championship two rounds later . As of 2024 , this is the most recent major league sports championship won by a Pittsburgh team . Professional team sports [ edit ] The City of Pittsburgh has had various professional sports franchises throughout its history and today is home to three teams competing at the highest professional level in their respective sports : the Pittsburgh Pirates of the MLB , the Pittsburgh Steelers of the NFL , and the Pittsburgh Penguins of the NHL .

[ 10 ] On April 15 , 1876 , Recreation Park was the site of a game between the Xanthas and the Pittsburgh Alleghenies ( alternately spelled `` Alleghenys '' [ 11 ] ) , an unrelated forerunner to the `` Alleghenys '' team which would later be renamed the Pirates . The Alleghenies won the game 7–3 . [ 12 ] The 1877 squad was the most successful yet , finishing within 1 game of the pennant in the International Association ; only a Canadian team had a better record , allowing the city potential bragging rights for being the best American team that season . 1882 marked the first `` major league '' and fully professional season for the Pittsburgh Alleghenies ( Pirates ) and in 1887 , the Alleghenies moved from American Association to the National League after owner William Nimick became frustrated over a contract dispute . [ 13 ] The Pirates were purchased in 1900 by Barney Dreyfuss , who would go down in history as the `` Father of the modern World Series '' and its precursor , the Chronicle-Telegraph Cup , both of which saw the Pirates participate in the inaugural series . He recruited Hall of Famers Fred Clarke and Pittsburgh native Honus Wagner and built the first concrete and steel ( first `` modern '' ) baseball stadium , Forbes Field . Under Dreyfuss , the Pirates won pre-World Series world titles in 1901 and 1902 , National League pennants from 1901–1903 , 1909 , 1925 and 1927 and World Series in 1909 and 1925 . The 1902 squad set major league records for winning percentage and even today is the second most winning team ever fielded in the sport . [ 14 ] The franchise won the World Series three more times— in 1960 , 1971 , and 1979 . In 1960 , the team became the first to win a World Series on a walk-off home run , hit by Bill Mazeroski , and they remain the only team to win on a walk-off homer in the decisive seventh game . In 1979 , the Pirates repeated the accomplishment of their own 1925 World Series team , coming back from a three-games-to-one deficit , winning three games in a row when facing elimination , for the title . Thus the Pirates became ( and they currently remain ) the only franchise in the history of all sports to win world titles more than once when coming back from a 3-1 deficit . The 1979 Pirates also are unique in that they are the only team in all sports to have players who captured all four MVP awards : Seasonal ( Willie Stargell , co-MVP with Keith Hernandez ) , All Star Game ( Dave Parker ) , NLCS ( Willie Stargell ) , and World Series ( Willie Stargell ) within a single season . [ 15 ] Since 1970 the team has won their division and qualified for the playoffs nine times : six in the 1970s , and three times in a row from 1990 to 1992 . Pirate players have won the league MVP award in 1960 ( Dick Groat ) , 1966 ( Roberto Clemente ) , 1978 ( Dave Parker ) , 1979 ( Willie Stargell ) , 1990 ( Barry Bonds ) , 1992 ( Barry Bonds ) , and 2013 ( Andrew McCutchen ) and the Cy Young Award in 1960 ( Vernon Law ) and 1990 ( Doug Drabek ) . In 2001 , the team opened PNC Park on the city 's North Shore , regularly ranked as one of the top three baseball parks in the country . In addition to the Pirates , the Pittsburgh Stogies , Pittsburgh Burghers and Pittsburgh Rebels played in various leagues from 1884 to 1915 . The Rebels won the pennant in 1912 and finished just a half game shy of a pennant in 1915 . [ 16 ] The Pittsburgh Keystones , Homestead Grays ( playing in the city limits ) , and Pittsburgh Crawfords played in the Negro leagues . With players including Josh Gibson and Cumberland Posey the Grays won 12 league titles—the most by any Negro league team [ 1 ] —including nine consecutive from 1937 to 1945 . The Crawfords finished their eight-year existence with a .633 winning percentage , with a line-up including Gibson , Cool Papa Bell , and Satchel Paige and claimed four straight league titles from 1933 until 1936 , with the 1935 team judged by some [ who ? ] as the greatest one to ever take the field in the Negro leagues , or perhaps in baseball period . Just as they initially played in the first `` modern '' ballpark in the majors ( Forbes Field ) , Crawfords owner Gus Greenlee constructed the first steel and concrete `` modern '' stadium in the Negro leagues , with Greenlee Field opening in the Hill District on April 29 , 1932 . [ 17 ] Basketball [ edit ] Pittsburgh South Side won Western Pennsylvania Basketball League and Central Basketball League titles in 1904 , 1907 and 1913 , coming in second place in 1908 , 1911 and 1915 . The `` Black Fives `` league enjoyed success in the city with Monticello-Loendi winning national championships in 1912 , and four in a row from 1920–23 . The Pittsburgh Pirates from 1937–39 and Pittsburgh Raiders in 1944–45 continued professional basketball in the city in the National Basketball League . Pittsburgh had one of the founding members of what became the NBA , the Pittsburgh Ironmen however only played a single season 1947–48 before folding . The Pittsburgh Renaissance ( or Rens ) played from 1961 until 1963 in the ABL , posting the city 's best record in almost 40 years when they finished 2nd in 1962 . The most lasting legacy of pro roundball in Pittsburgh was the Pittsburgh Pipers-Pittsburgh Condors of the American Basketball Association from 1967 until 1972 . In the first ABA World Championship in 1968 , the Pipers defeated the New Orleans Buccaneers , which were owned by Harry Connick Sr. [ citation needed ] After the ABA Pipers/Condors folded in 1972 the city hosted the Pittsburgh Piranhas of the CBA in the mid-1990s . The franchise made it to the championship round in the 1994–95 season . Taking the series into the 6th game the Piranhas lost by a basket in the final seconds ( 92-94 ) by what they claimed was an ineligible player , the CBA denied a replay game in what would have been Pittsburgh 's second pro-basketball world title . [ 1 ] In the late 2000s the Pittsburgh Xplosion , a development league team owned by former NBA player Freddie Lewis , [ 18 ] played in a revamped ABA/CBA at Mellon Arena and the Petersen Events Center before ceasing operations prior to the 2008–09 season because of the economic recession . Another professional basketball team , the Pittsburgh Phantoms of the American Basketball Association , played during the 2009–10 season and held their games at the Carnegie Library of Homestead , but folded prior to the following season . Hockey [ edit ] See also : Flyers–Penguins rivalry and Sports in Philadelphia § Pittsburgh First played in Pittsburgh in 1895 , ice hockey grew in popularity after the Duquesne Gardens opened in 1899 . In 1901 the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League ( WPHL ) , a semi-professional ice hockey league based in Pittsburgh in the early 1900s , may have been involved in the first trade involving professional hockey players . In 1907 , the WPHL was the first league to openly hire hockey players . The league played its games in three Pittsburgh hockey arenas , the Gardens , the Schenley Park Casino and the Winter Garden at Exposition Hall . The Casino , which was destroyed by a fire in 1896 , had the first artificial ice surface in North America , was the first place in Pittsburgh where organized ice hockey was played and had the most modern indoor lighting system of the time era , that consisted of 1,500 incandescent lamps , 11 arc lights and 4 white calcium lights . In 1905–1907 , the city was represented in the International Professional Hockey League , the first fully professional hockey league , by the Pittsburgh Professionals . Pittsburgh Civic Arena was replaced by the venue now known as PPG Paints Arena in 2010 . The Gardens housed the largest indoor rink in the world and was home to the city 's first NHL franchise , the Pittsburgh Pirates , from 1925 to 1930 . The Gardens also was home to the Pittsburgh Shamrocks and the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets of the International Hockey League as well as the Pittsburgh Hornets of the American Hockey League . [ 19 ] In 1961 , Pittsburgh Civic Arena was constructed for use of the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera . Founded , by Jack McGregor and Peter Block as part of the 1967 NHL expansion , the Pittsburgh Penguins have played home games in downtown Pittsburgh since their inception—first at the Civic Arena , and since 2010 at PPG Paints Arena . [ 20 ] The Penguins won back-to-back Stanley Cup championships in 1991 and 1992 . The franchise recorded their third Stanley Cup in 2009 . [ 21 ] The teams included players Mark Recchi , Kevin Stevens , Jaromír Jágr , and Mario Lemieux . [ 22 ] Lemieux holds multiple franchise records and was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1997 . [ 23 ] [ 24 ] He suffered from multiple injuries , including Hodgkin 's lymphoma , throughout his career . [ 25 ] In 1999 , Lemieux purchased the Penguins and saved the franchise from bankruptcy . He returned to play one year later as the first player/owner of the modern era . [ 26 ] The Penguins , led by top point scorers Evgeni Malkin and Sidney Crosby , returned to the Stanley Cup finals in 2008 and won the franchise 's third Cup in 2009 . [ 27 ] The franchise recorded their fourth Stanley Cup in 2016 and their fifth Stanley Cup in 2017 . Football [ edit ] On November 12 , 1892 , Pudge Heffelfinger was paid $ 500 to participate in an American football game for the Allegheny Athletic Association . With this transaction , Heffelfinger became the first person to be paid to play football . [ citation needed ] The first professional football game was held at Recreation Park in Pittsburgh . [ citation needed ] Heffelfinger scored the game 's only points as the Allegheny Athletic Association defeated the Pittsburgh Athletic Club ,
