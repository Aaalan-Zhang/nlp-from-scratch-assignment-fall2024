Born Myron Sidney Kopelman [ 1 ] January 23 , 1929 Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , U.S. Died February 27 , 2008 ( 2008-02-27 ) ( aged 79 ) Mt . Lebanon , Pennsylvania , U.S . Known for 5× Super Bowl champion ( IX , X , XIII , XIV , XL ) 5× AFC champion ( 1974 , 1975 , 1978–79 NFL playoffs , 1979 , 2005 ) Sports commentary career Team Pittsburgh Steelers Sport American football Myron Sidney Kopelman ( January 23 , 1929 – February 27 , 2008 ) , known professionally as Myron Cope , was an American sports journalist , radio personality , and sportscaster . He is best known for being `` the voice of the Pittsburgh Steelers `` . Cope was a color commentator for the Steelers ' radio broadcasts for 35 years . He was known for his distinctive , higher-pitched nasally voice with an identifiable Pittsburgh accent , idiosyncratic speech pattern , and a level of excitement rarely exhibited in the broadcast booth . Cope 's most notable catch phrase was `` yoi '' [ 2 ] / ˈ j ɔɪ / . Cope was the first football announcer inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame . [ 3 ] Cope 's autobiography , Double Yoi ! , was published in 2002 . [ 4 ] Education and career [ edit ] Born in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , to Jewish parents of Lithuanian ancestry , Cope graduated from Taylor Allderdice High School in 1947 and was inducted into their alumni hall of fame in 2009 . [ 5 ] [ 6 ] He also graduated from the University of Pittsburgh . [ 7 ] He was originally a journalist before becoming a broadcaster . His first job as a journalist was in Erie , Pennsylvania , with the Daily Times , [ 8 ] and by the summer of 1951 , he was working for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette . [ 9 ] Cope then became a freelance journalist , most notably for Sports Illustrated , [ 1 ] the Saturday Evening Post , [ 8 ] and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette . [ 3 ] In 1963 , Cope received the E.P . Dutton Prize for `` Best Magazine Sportswriting in the Nation '' , for a portrayal of Cassius Clay . [ 10 ] Cope spent the 1983 college football season as a color analyst for the Pittsburgh Panthers . [ 7 ] In 1987 , he was named by the Hearst Corporation as a noted literary achiever , along with Mark Twain , Jack London , Frederic Remington , Walter Winchell , and Sidney Sheldon . [ 10 ] At its 50th anniversary , Sports Illustrated selected Cope 's profile of Howard Cosell as one of the 50 best written works ever published in the magazine . [ 3 ] Family life [ edit ] Cope married Mildred Lindberg of Charleston in 1965 , and the couple moved to Mt . Lebanon . [ 11 ] In 1972 , the Copes moved to nearby Upper St. Clair . [ 12 ] Mildred died on September 20 , 1994 . [ 9 ] In 1999 , Cope moved back to Mt . Lebanon , to a condo in the Woodridge neighborhood . [ 12 ] He remained there until his final days , when he entered a Mt . Lebanon nursing home . [ 8 ] Cope had three children , Elizabeth , Martha Ann , and Daniel . [ 9 ] Martha Ann died shortly after her birth . [ 13 ] His son , Daniel , was born with severe autism ; he has lived most of his life at the Allegheny Valley School , an institution specializing in intellectual developmental disabilities . [ 14 ] Cope devoted much of his time and energy to Pittsburgh causes addressing autism , and spoke candidly about his experiences as the parent of a child with autism and his efforts to better educate the public at large about autism . [ 14 ] Steelers broadcasting [ edit ] Cope waves a Terrible Towel at Heinz Field – October 31 , 2005 In 1968 , Cope began doing daily sports commentaries on what was then WTAE-AM radio in Pittsburgh . [ 15 ] His unique nasal voice , with a distinctive Pittsburgh area accent , was noticed by the Steelers ' brass , and he made his debut as a member of the Steelers ' radio team in 1970 . [ 16 ] During Cope 's 35-year broadcasting career with the Steelers—the second longest term with a single team in NFL history , he was accompanied by only two play-by-play announcers : Jack Fleming , with whom he broadcast until 1994 , and Bill Hillgrove . [ 8 ] [ 13 ] In keeping with his comic personality , a series of television commentaries on WTAE-TV saw Cope calling himself `` Doctor Cope '' and wearing a white lab coat while pretending to examine the opposing team 's strengths and weaknesses . His predictor was known as the `` Cope-ra-scope . '' [ 17 ] In his last seven years , Cope would work alongside former Steelers offensive tackle Tunch Ilkin in the booth and help groom him for his own broadcasting career . Ilkin , upon his own retirement in 2021 due to complications from ALS ( which he would later die from on September 4 , 2021 ) , later joked that while he learned a lot from riding in the car with Cope for away games , Cope primarily rode with him because he allowed Cope to smoke cigarettes in the car . [ 18 ] Ilkin would eventually serve as a de facto replacement for Cope following Cope 's retirement . Catchphrases and nicknames [ edit ] Like other sports announcers in Pittsburgh , particularly Penguins commentator Mike Lange and the late Pirates announcer Bob Prince , Cope had a repertoire of unique catchphrases employed in his broadcasts , such as `` Mmm-Hah ! '' ( when he loses his train of thought , or forgets a player 's name ) and `` Okel Dokel '' ( his version of `` okey dokey '' ) . [ 8 ] Cope often used Yiddish expressions , especially `` Feh ! '' and `` Yoi ! '' ( sometimes multiplied as `` Double Yoi '' or rarely `` Triple Yoi '' ) . Cope also created nicknames for many players and opposing teams . It was Cope who popularized `` The Bus '' as a nickname for former Steelers running back Jerome Bettis , `` Jack Splat '' for Jack Lambert , and he gave Kordell Stewart the nickname `` Slash . '' [ 19 ] Cope also used the term `` Cincinnati Bungles '' to describe their division rivals , known during the 1990s for a string of bad seasons and numerous draft busts . [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] Myron also used terms such as `` Brownies , '' `` Birdies , '' `` Yonkos , '' `` Cryboys , '' and `` Redfaces '' for the football teams from Cleveland , Baltimore , Denver , Dallas , Washington , D.C. , in respective order . [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] Cope was noted for accusing future Hall of Famer Roberto Clemente of being `` baseball 's champion hypochondriac '' . [ 27 ] Terrible Towel [ edit ] Main article : Terrible Towel I said , what we need is something that everybody already has , so it does n't cost a dime . So I says , 'We 'll urge people to bring out to the game gold or black towels , ' then I 'll tell people if you do n't have a yellow , black or gold towel , buy one . And if you do n't want to buy one , dye one . We 'll call this the Terrible Towel . — Myron Cope on the invention of the Terrible Towel [ 28 ] Cope played a large role in the invention of the Terrible Towel . [ 29 ] Needing a way to excite the fans during a 1975 playoff game against the Baltimore Colts , Cope urged fans to take yellow dish towels to the game and wave them throughout . [ 28 ] Originally , Cope wanted to sell rubber Jack Lambert masks , but realizing the high costs for the masks , opted for the inexpensive option for the Terrible Towel . The Terrible Towel has gained much popularity since its invention and `` is arguably the best-known fan symbol of any major pro sports team '' . [ 29 ] The catchphrase is : `` The Terrible Towel is poised to strike , and so are The Steelers . '' In 1996 , Cope gave the rights to The Terrible Towel to the Allegheny Valley School in Coraopolis , Pennsylvania . [ 14 ] The school provides care for more than 900 people [ 30 ] with intellectual disabilities and physical disabilities , including Cope 's son who has severe autism . [ 2 ] Proceeds from the Terrible Towel have helped raise $ 3 million for the school . [ 31 ] Retirement and death [ edit ] A special edition of `` The Terrible Towel '' was created in honor of Cope 's retirement following the 2005 Steelers ' season . Cope announced his retirement from broadcasting on June 20 , 2005 , citing health concerns . [ 32 ] Eight days later , it was announced that Cope was the recipient of the Pete Rozelle Award for `` long-time exceptional contributions to radio and television in professional football . '' [ 33 ] Upon his retirement , the Steelers did not replace Cope , opting instead to downsize to a two-man broadcast team . [ 13 ] On October 31 , 2005 , Cope was honored for his lifetime accomplishments at halftime of the contest between the Steelers and the Ravens . [ 34 ] In addition , the Steelers produced a special commemorative edition Terrible Towel with his familiar expressions printed on it . As seen on the towel , production was limited to 35,000 towels , representing 35 years of service to the Steelers . Later that season when the team advanced to Super Bowl XL , many Steelers fans wanted Cope to come out of retirement just to call `` The one for the thumb . '' Cope declined partially for health reasons and partially to enjoy retirement . [ citation needed ] A longtime heavy smoker , Cope died of respiratory failure at a Mt . Lebanon nursing home on the morning of February 27 , 2008 . [ 13 ] [ 35 ] In the days following his death , many ceremonies were held in his honor , including the local sporting events of the Pittsburgh Panthers college basketball team . [ 36 ] Two days after his death , hundreds of people gathered in heavy snow in front of the Pittsburgh City Hall to honor Cope ; included in the ceremony was one minute of silent Terrible Towel waving . [ 37 ] His funeral , which was held on February 29 , 2008 , was private . [ 38 ] Due to Cope 's large impact on the Pittsburgh area , Bob Smizik , a local sportswriter wrote , Had the secret of the service and its site not been kept , ... tens of thousands would have descended on the Slater funeral home in Green Tree . Such was the affection for Cope , ... that the parkway in both directions would have been clogged . Greentree and Cochran roads , the two main arteries leading to the funeral home , would have been parking lots .
