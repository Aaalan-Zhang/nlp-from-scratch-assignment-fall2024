Lithograph by Thaddeus Mortimer Fowler . The history of Pittsburgh began with centuries of Native American civilization in the modern Pittsburgh region , known as Jaödeogë ’ in the Seneca language . [ 1 ] Eventually , European explorers encountered the strategic confluence where the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers meet to form the Ohio , which leads to the Mississippi River . The area became a battleground when France and Great Britain fought for control in the 1750s . When the British were victorious , the French ceded control of territories east of the Mississippi . Following American independence in 1783 , the village around Fort Pitt continued to grow . The region saw the short-lived Whiskey Rebellion , when farmers rebelled against federal taxes on whiskey . The War of 1812 cut off the supply of British goods , stimulating American manufacture . By 1815 , Pittsburgh was producing large quantities of iron , brass , tin , and glass products . By the 1840s , Pittsburgh had grown to be one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains . Production of steel began in 1875 . During the 1877 railway riots it was the site of the most violence and damage in any city affected by the nationwide strikes of that summer . Workers protested against cuts in wages , burning down buildings at the railyards , including 100 train engines and more than 1,000 cars . Forty men were killed , most of them strikers . By 1911 , Pittsburgh was producing half the nation 's steel . Pittsburgh was a Republican party stronghold until 1932 . The soaring unemployment of the Great Depression , the New Deal relief programs and the rise of powerful labor unions in the 1930s turned the city into a liberal stronghold of the New Deal Coalition under powerful Democratic mayors . In World War II , it was the center of the `` Arsenal of Democracy `` , producing munitions for the Allied war effort as prosperity returned . Following World War II , Pittsburgh launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the `` Renaissance . '' The industrial base continued to expand through the 1960s , but after 1970 foreign competition led to the collapse of the steel industry , with massive layoffs and mill closures . Top corporate headquarters moved out in the 1980s . In 2007 the city lost its status as a major transportation hub . The population of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area is holding steady at 2.4 million ; 65 % of its residents are of European descent and 35 % are minorities . Native American era [ edit ] Native Americans lived near the forks of the Ohio for thousands of years . These are some important villages , most c. 1750s , and earlier sites . For thousands of years , Native Americans inhabited the region where the Allegheny and the Monongahela join to form the Ohio . Paleo-Indians conducted a hunter-gatherer lifestyle in the region perhaps as early as 19,000 years ago . Meadowcroft Rockshelter , an archaeological site west of Pittsburgh , provides evidence that these first Americans lived in the region from that date . [ 2 ] During the Adena culture that followed , Mound Builders erected a large Indian Mound at the future site of McKees Rocks , about three miles ( 5 km ) from the head of the Ohio . The Indian Mound , a burial site , was augmented in later years by members of the Hopewell culture . [ 3 ] By 1700 the Haudenosaunee , the Five Nations-based south of the Great Lakes in present-day New York , held dominion over the upper Ohio valley , reserving it for hunting grounds . Other tribes included the Lenape , who had been displaced from eastern Pennsylvania by European settlement , and the Shawnee , who had migrated up from the south . [ 4 ] With the arrival of European explorers , these tribes and others had been devastated by infectious diseases from Europe , such as smallpox , measles , influenza , and malaria , to which they had no immunity . [ 5 ] A map of Western Pennsylvania made in 1680 from the Darlington Collection In 1748 , when Conrad Weiser visited Logstown , 18 miles ( 29 km ) downriver from Pittsburgh , he counted 789 warriors gathered : the Iroquois included 163 Seneca , 74 Mohawk , 35 Onondaga , 20 Cayuga , and 15 Oneida . Other tribes were 165 Lenape , 162 Shawnee , 100 Wyandot , 40 Tisagechroami , and 15 Mohican . [ 6 ] Shannopin 's Town , a Lenape ( Delaware ) village on the east bank of the Allegheny , was established in the 1720s and was deserted after 1758 . The village is believed to have been roughly from where Penn Avenue is today , below the mouth of Two Mile Run , from 30th Street to 39th Street . According to George Croghan , the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny , nearly opposite what is now known as Herr 's Island , in what is now the Lawrenceville neighborhood in the city of Pittsburgh . [ 7 ] : 289 Sawcunk , on the mouth of the Beaver River , was a Lenape settlement and the principal residence of Shingas , a chief of theirs . [ 8 ] Chartier 's Town was a Shawnee town established in 1734 by Peter Chartier . Kittanning was a Lenape and Shawnee village on the Allegheny , with an estimated 300–400 residents . [ 9 ] Early colonization ( 1747–1763 ) [ edit ] British and French Forts , 1753–1758 , and the routes of the two British campaigns to take the forks of the Ohio The first Europeans arrived in the 1710s as traders . Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a manuscript in 1717 , and later that year European traders established posts and settlements in the area . [ 10 ] Europeans first began to settle in the region in 1748 , when the first Ohio Company , a Virginian land speculation company , won a grant of 200,000 acres ( 800 km 2 ) in the upper Ohio Valley . From a post at present-day Cumberland , Maryland , the company began to construct an 80-mile ( 130 km ) wagon road to the Monongahela River [ 11 ] employing a Lenape Indian chief named Nemacolin and a party of settlers headed by Capt . Michael Cresap to begin widening the track into a road . It mostly followed the same route as an existing Native American trail [ 12 ] now known as Nemacolin 's Trail . The river crossing and flats at Redstone creek , was the earliest point and shortest distance for the descent of a wagon road . Later in the war , the site fortified as Fort Burd ( now Brownsville ) was one of several possible destinations . Another alternative was the divergent route that became Braddock 's Road a few years later through present-day New Stanton . In the event , the colonists did not succeed in turning the path into a wagon road much beyond the Cumberland Narrows pass before they came into conflict with Native Americans . The colonists later mounted a series of expeditions in order to accomplish piecemeal improvements to the track . The nearby Native American community of Logstown was an important trade and council center in the Ohio Valley . [ 6 ] Between June 15 and November 10 , 1749 , an expedition headed by Celeron de Bienville , a French officer , traveled down the Allegheny and Ohio to bolster the French claim to the region . [ 12 ] De Bienville warned away British traders and posted markers claiming the territory . [ 13 ] In 1753 , Marquis Duquesne , the Governor of New France , sent another , larger expedition . At present-day Erie , Pennsylvania , an advance party built Fort Presque Isle . They also cut a road through the woods and built Fort Le Boeuf on French Creek , from which it was possible at high water to float to the Allegheny . By summer , an expedition of 1,500 French and Native American men descended the Allegheny . Some wintered at the confluence of French Creek and the Allegheny . The following year , they built Fort Machault at that site . [ 14 ] Alarmed at these French incursions in the Ohio Valley , Governor Dinwiddie of Virginia sent Major George Washington to warn the French to withdraw . [ 15 ] Accompanied by Christopher Gist , Washington arrived at the Forks of the Ohio on November 25 , 1753 . George Washington 's sketch of Monongahela River , Allegheny River ( named as the upper Ohio ) , and French Creek that accompanied his journal ( 1753 ) in which he recorded his impressions : [ 16 ] As I got down before the Canoe , I spent some Time in viewing the Rivers , & the Land in the Fork , which I think extremely well situated for a Fort ; as it has the absolute Command of both Rivers . The Land at the Point is 20 or 25 feet ( 7.6 m ) above the common Surface of the Water ; & a considerable Bottom of flat well timber 'd Land all around it , very convenient for Building . Proceeding up the Allegheny , Washington presented Dinwiddie 's letter to the French commanders first at Venango , and then Fort Le Boeuf . The French officers received Washington with wine and courtesy , but did not withdraw . [ 15 ] Governor Dinwiddie sent Captain William Trent to build a fort at the Forks of the Ohio . On February 17 , 1754 , Trent began construction of the fort , the first European habitation [ 17 ] at the site of present-day Pittsburgh . The fort , named Fort Prince George , was only half-built by April 1754 , when over 500 French forces arrived and ordered the 40-some colonials back to Virginia . The French tore down the British fortification and constructed Fort Duquesne . [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Governor Dinwiddie launched another expedition . Colonel Joshua Fry commanded the regiment with his second-in-command , George Washington , leading an advance column . On May 28 , 1754 , Washington 's unit clashed with the French in the Battle of Jumonville Glen , during which 13 French soldiers were killed and 21 were taken prisoner . [ 18 ] After the battle , Washington 's ally , Seneca chief Tanaghrisson , unexpectedly executed the French commanding officer , Ensign Joseph Coulon de Jumonville . The French pursued Washington and on July 3 , 1754 , George Washington surrendered following the Battle of Fort Necessity . These frontier actions contributed to the start of the French and Indian War ( 1754–1763 ) , or , the Seven Years ' War , a global confrontation between Britain and France fought in both hemispheres . [ 15 ] [ 19 ] The Fort Pitt Blockhouse , dating to 1764 , is the oldest structure in Pittsburgh . [ 15 ] In 1755 , the Braddock Expedition was launched , accompanied by Virginia militia officer George Washington . Two regiments marched from Fort Cumberland across the Allegheny Mountains and into western Pennsylvania . Following a path Washington surveyed , over 3,000 men built a wagon road 12 feet ( 3.7 m ) wide , that when complete , was the first road to cross the Appalachian Mountains . Braddock 's Road , as it was known , blazed the way for the future National Road ( US40 ) . The expedition crossed the Monongahela River on July 9 , 1755 . French troops from Fort Duquesne ambushed Braddock 's expedition at Braddock 's Field , nine miles ( 14 km ) from Fort Duquesne . [ 20 ] In the Battle of the Monongahela , the French inflicted heavy losses on the British , and Braddock was mortally wounded . [ 21 ] The surviving British and colonial forces retreated . This left the French and their Native American allies with dominion over the upper Ohio valley . [ 15 ] On September 8 , 1756 , an expedition of 300 militiamen destroyed the Shawnee and Lenape village of Kittanning , and in the summer of 1758 , British Army officer John Forbes began a campaign to capture Fort Duquesne . [ 21 ] At the head of 7,000 regular and colonial troops , Forbes built Fort Ligonier and Fort Bedford , from where he cut a wagon road over the Allegheny Mountains , later known as Forbes ' Road . On the night of September 13–14 , 1758 , an advance column under Major James Grant was annihilated in the Battle of Fort Duquesne . [ 21 ] The battleground , the high hill east of the Point , was named Grant 's Hill in his memory . With this defeat , Forbes decided to wait until spring . But when he heard that the French had lost Fort Frontenac and largely evacuated Fort Duquesne , he planned an immediate attack . Hopelessly outnumbered , the French abandoned and razed Fort Duquesne . Forbes occupied the burned fort on November 25 , 1758 , and ordered the construction of Fort Pitt , named after British Secretary of State William Pitt the Elder . He also named the settlement between the rivers , `` Pittsborough '' ( see Etymology of Pittsburgh ) . [ 11 ] [ 15 ] The British garrison at Fort Pitt made substantial improvements to its fortification . [ 11 ] The French never attacked Fort Pitt and the war soon ended with the Treaty of Paris and French defeat . [ 15 ] They ceded their territories east of the Mississippi River . Gateway to the West ( 1763–1799 ) [ edit ] In 1760 , the first considerable European settlement around Fort Pitt began to grow . Traders and settlers built two groups of houses and cabins , the `` lower town , '' near the fort 's ramparts , and the `` upper town , '' along the Monongahela as far as present-day Market Street . In April 1761 , a census ordered by Colonel Henry Bouquet and conducted by William Clapham counted 332 people and 104 houses . [ 21 ] [ 22 ] : 148 After Britain 's victory in the French and Indian War , increasing dissatisfaction among Native Americans with the continuing encroachment of settlers on lands that had been agreed would be Indian-occupied ( both in the 1758 Treaty of Easton and in the Royal Proclamation of 1763 the British authorities had decreed that there would be no British-American settlements west of the Alleghenies , but the authorities had been unable or unwilling to enforce these decrees ) led to the outbreak of Pontiac 's War . The Odawa leader Pontiac launched an offensive against British forts in May 1763 . Native American tribes from the Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes overran numerous British forts ; one of their most important targets was Fort Pitt . Receiving warning of the coming attack , Captain Simeon Ecuyer , the Swiss officer in command of the garrison , prepared for a siege . He leveled the houses outside the ramparts and ordered all settlers into the fort : 330 men , 104 women , and 196 children sought refuge inside its ramparts . [ 11 ] Captain Ecuyer also gathered stores , which included hundreds of barrels of pork and beef . Pontiac 's forces attacked the fort on June 22 , 1763 , and the siege of Fort Pitt lasted for two months . [ 15 ] Pontiac 's warriors kept up a continuous , though ineffective , fire on it from July 27 through August 1 , 1763 . [ 21 ] They drew off to confront the relieving party under Colonel Bouquet , which defeated them in the Battle of Bushy Run . [ 21 ] This victory ensured British dominion over the forks of the Ohio , if not the entire Ohio valley . In 1764 Colonel Bouquet added a redoubt , the Fort Pitt Blockhouse , which still stands , the sole remaining structure from Fort Pitt and the oldest authenticated building west of the Allegheny Mountains . [ 15 ] Fort Pitt , 1795 The Iroquois signed the Fort Stanwix Treaty of 1768 , ceding the lands south of the Ohio to the British Crown . [ 21 ] European expansion into the upper Ohio valley increased . An estimated 4,000 to 5,000 families settled in western Pennsylvania between 1768 and 1770 . Of these settlers ,
