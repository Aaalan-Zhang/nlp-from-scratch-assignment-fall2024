The institution was established in 1900 by Andrew Carnegie as the Carnegie Technical Schools . In 1912, it became the Carnegie Institute of Technology and began granting four-year degrees. In 1967, it became Carnegie Mellon University through its merger with the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research , founded in 1913 by Andrew Mellon and Richard B. Mellon and formerly a part of the University of Pittsburgh . [ 11 ] The university consists of seven colleges, including the College of Engineering , the School of Computer Science , and the Tepper School of Business . [ 12 ] The university has its main campus located 5 miles (8 km) from downtown Pittsburgh . It also has over a dozen degree-granting locations in six continents, including campuses in Qatar , Silicon Valley , and Kigali, Rwanda ( Carnegie Mellon University Africa ) and partnerships with universities nationally and globally. [ 13 ] Carnegie Mellon enrolls 15,818 students across its multiple campuses from 117 countries and employs more than 1,400 faculty members. [ 14 ] Carnegie Mellon is known for its advances in research and new fields of study, home to many firsts in computer science (including the first machine learning , robotics , and computational biology departments), pioneering the field of management science , [ 15 ] and the first drama program in the United States. Carnegie Mellon is a member of the Association of American Universities and is classified among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very High Research Activity". [ 16 ] Carnegie Mellon competes in NCAA Division III athletics as a founding member of the University Athletic Association . Carnegie Mellon fields eight men's teams and nine women's teams as the Tartans. [ 17 ] The university's faculty and alumni include 21 Nobel Prize laureates and 13 Turing Award winners and have received 142 Emmy Awards , 64 Tony Awards , and 13 Academy Awards . [ 18 ] History [ edit ] Andrew Carnegie , founder of the Carnegie Technical Schools. Andrew Mellon , co-founder of the Mellon Institute. The Carnegie Technical Schools were founded in 1900 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania [ 19 ] by the Scottish-American industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie , who wrote "My heart is in the work", when he donated the funds to create the institution. Carnegie's vision was to open a vocational training school for the sons and daughters of working-class Pittsburghers, many of whom worked in his mills. Carnegie was inspired for the design of his school by the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York , founded by industrialist Charles Pratt in 1887. [ 20 ] In 1912, the institution changed its name to Carnegie Institute of Technology (CIT) and began offering four-year degrees. During this time, CIT consisted of four constituent schools: the School of Fine and Applied Arts, the School of Apprentices and Journeymen, the School of Science and Technology, and the Margaret Morrison Carnegie School for Women . The Mellon Institute of Industrial Research was founded in 1913 by banker and industrialist brothers Andrew Mellon (who went on to become U.S. Treasury Secretary ) and Richard B. Mellon in honor of their father, Thomas Mellon , patriarch of the Mellon family . The Institute began as a research organization that performed contract work for government and industry, initially as a department within the University of Pittsburgh . In 1927, the Mellon Institute was incorporated as an independent nonprofit. In 1937, the Mellon Institute's iconic building was completed on Fifth Avenue. [ 21 ] In 1967, with support from Paul Mellon , the Carnegie Institute of Technology merged with the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research to become Carnegie Mellon University. In 1973, Carnegie Mellon's coordinate women's college , the Margaret Morrison Carnegie College, merged its academic programs with the rest of the university. [ 22 ] The industrial research mission of the Mellon Institute survived the merger as the Carnegie Mellon Research Institute (CMRI) and continued doing work on contract to industry and government. In 2001, CMRI's programs were subsumed by other parts of the university or spun off into autonomous entities. [ 23 ] Campus [ edit ] The main campus in Pittsburgh as seen from the 36th floor of the Cathedral of Learning at the University of Pittsburgh , August 2015. Overview [ edit ] Carnegie Mellon's 157.2 acre (63 ha) main campus is five miles (8 km) from downtown Pittsburgh , between Schenley Park and the neighborhoods of Squirrel Hill , Shadyside , and Oakland . [ 5 ] Carnegie Mellon is bordered to the west by the campus of the University of Pittsburgh . Carnegie Mellon owns 81 buildings in the Oakland and Squirrel Hill neighborhoods of Pittsburgh. For decades, the center of student life on campus was Skibo Hall, the university's student union. Built in the 1950s, Skibo Hall's design was typical of mid-century modern architecture but was poorly equipped to deal with advances in computer and internet connectivity. The original Skibo Hall was razed in the summer of 1994 and replaced by a new student union that is fully Wi-Fi enabled. Known as the University Center, the building was dedicated in 1996. In 2014, Carnegie Mellon re-dedicated the University Center as the Cohon University Center in recognition of the eighth president of the university, Jared Cohon . [ 24 ] A large grassy area known as "The Cut" forms the backbone of the campus, with a separate grassy area known as "The Mall" running perpendicular. The Cut was formed by filling in a ravine (hence the name) with soil from a nearby hill that was leveled to build the College of Fine Arts building. The northwestern part of the campus (home to Hamburg Hall, Newell-Simon Hall, Smith Hall, and Gates Hillman Complex) was acquired from the United States Bureau of Mines in the 1980s. Carnegie Mellon has been purchasing 100% renewable energy for its electricity since 2011. [ 25 ] A panoramic view of Carnegie Mellon University's Pittsburgh campus from the College of Fine Arts Lawn.

Also visible are "The Fence", and the Walking to the Sky sculpture. Campus architecture and design [ edit ] The campus began to take shape in the Beaux-Arts architecture style of George Carnegie Palmer and Henry Hornbostel of Palmer & Hornbostel, winners of the 1904 competition to design the original institution and later the founder of the Carnegie Mellon School of Architecture . [ 26 ] There was little change to the campus between the first and second World War . A 1938 master plan by Githens and Keally suggested acquisition of new land along Forbes Avenue , but the plan was not fully implemented. The period starting with the construction of the Hall of the Arts building (former home of the Graduate School of Industrial Administration) in 1952 and ending with Wean Hall in 1971 saw the institutional change from Carnegie Institute of Technology to Carnegie Mellon University. New facilities were needed to respond to the university's growing national reputation in artificial intelligence , business, robotics and the arts. In addition, an expanding student population demanded improved facilities for student life, athletics and libraries. The campus finally expanded to Forbes Avenue from its original land along Schenley Park . Hamerschlag, Roberts, and Scott Halls are three of the teaching facilities of the College of Engineering The buildings of this era reflected contemporary architectural styles. The International Style , with its rejection of historical tradition and its emphases on functionalism and expression of structure, had been in vogue in European settings since the 1930s.
