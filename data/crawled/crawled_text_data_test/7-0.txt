Washington The economy of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania is diversified, focused on services , medicine , higher education , tourism , banking , corporate headquarters and high technology . Once the center of the American steel industry , and still known as " The Steel City ", today the city of Pittsburgh has no steel mills within its limits, though Pittsburgh-based companies such as US Steel , Ampco Pittsburgh and Allegheny Technologies own several working mills in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area . Pittsburgh was chosen for the 2009 G-20 summit as its transformation is an example of a 21st-century economy. On September 8, 2009, President Barack Obama stated, "Pittsburgh stands as a bold example of how to create new jobs and industries while transitioning to a 21st century economy." [ 1 ] On the list of best cities for job growth in 2009, created by Tara Weiss, a writer for Forbes magazine, Pittsburgh secured its spot because of its strength in the health care and education industries with healthy foundations in technology or robotics and banking industries. [ 2 ] The 2009 list of all cities places Pittsburgh as the 169th-best city for job growth. [ 3 ] Pittsburgh has also ranked in the top five most livable cities in four of the seven multi-year rankings of Places Rated Almanac (1983, 1985, 1989, and 2007). [ 4 ] History [ edit ] Main article: History of Pittsburgh Early foundation [ edit ] Early look at Pittsburgh During the mid-18th century, the economy of the Pittsburgh region was focused on agriculture and trade. After the American Revolutionary War , the government placed a tax on whiskey in order to pay off national debt. In 1794, the Whiskey Rebellion occurred in Pittsburgh and was the first challenge to the government.“The fledgling Federal government had decided to levy its first tax against whiskey , but the farmers argued they didn't have cash to pay taxes on bartered goods, and marched in protest. Washington had to send troops to squelch the protest and enforce the tax laws.” [ 5 ] During the 18th century, large coal deposits were discovered throughout Pittsburgh. Mount Washington , originally called "Coal Hill", the “most valuable deposit of bituminous coal in the entire United States, was discovered there in 1760”. [ 6 ] Along with the natural resources of the area, Pittsburgh was located at the intersection of the Monongahela , Ohio , and Allegheny Rivers, that is, along the major trade routes of the United States, thus making Pittsburgh "one of the world's leading industrial powerhouses". “The first and largest industry emerging in the 1800s was boat building—both flatboats to transport waves of pioneers and goods downriver, and keelboats, which a strong crew could propel upstream as well.” [ 5 ] The second biggest industry in the region was glass production . The first glass factory was built in 1795 by James O'Hara and Isaac Craig . [ 5 ] Nineteenth century [ edit ] Pittsburgh’s wealthiest industrialists during the 19th century all lived in a single neighborhood known as East Liberty . The major list of industrialists includes H. J. Heinz , George Westinghouse , Andrew Carnegie , Thomas Mellon , Andrew Mellon , Henry Clay Frick and Philander Knox . All of these men shared similar ideas in the system of capitalism and utilized their skills to net the world’s highest income per capita during the 19th century in this single neighborhood. [ 7 ] Andrew Carnegie was also known as a philanthropist to the region. “In 1889 he wrote " The Gospel of Wealth ", in which he asserted that all personal wealth beyond that required to supply the needs of one's family should be regarded as a trust fund to be administered for the benefit of the community”. [ 8 ] Subsequently, the Carnegie Library , which is free to the public, opened in Pittsburgh in 1890 and is still open presently. [ 9 ] Overall, Carnegie donated over $350 million for the establishment of organizations that benefit the public. [ 8 ] Wealthy industrialists founded the Duquesne Club in 1873 and the Greater Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce in 1874. The Pittsburgh Stock Exchange was also formed in 1864 as the "Oil Exchange" before becoming the "Coal Exchange" in 1870 and then back to the "Oil Exchange" in 1878 until opening for all general stocks by 1894. The stock exchange closed its Fourth Avenue "financial district" doors in August 1974 after computerization had consolidated trades in New York, Chicago and other global centers but not before a 1966 response from the New York Stock Exchange board of possibly relocating their trading floor to the city's facilities. [ 10 ] Railroad networks reached the Pittsburgh area in the mid-19th century. The Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad opened in 1851, which allowed passengers to travel through Allegheny and New Brighton while the Pennsylvania Railroad established "Pittsburgh service" as close as Turtle Creek from their Philadelphia hub that same year. A year later, in 1852, the Pennsylvania Railroad was completed to Downtown Pittsburgh . In 1856, the Allegheny Valley Railroad was built. [ 9 ] [ 11 ] Andrew Carnegie was one of the first to capitalize on the railways; in 1865 he founded the Pittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works which would be an industry leader from the city until 1919. In 1892, the economy of Pittsburgh faced the Homestead Strike between the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers and the Carnegie Steel Company . After the workers' previous wage contract expired in 1892, and a new negotiation was not reached, a violent conflict ensued leaving several dead and wounded. Ultimately, The Carnegie Steel company won and had avoided union formation in Pittsburgh. [ 12 ] Emergence of "Big Steel" [ edit ] After Carnegie Steel was reorganized as U.S. Steel in 1901, it and J&L Steel dominated the local economy. Several secondary players contributed to the capacity of the metro area such as Cyclops Steel in Bridgeville, Pennsylvania from 1908 until 1987, Mesta Machinery in West Homestead, Pennsylvania from 1898 until 1983, Dravo Corporation at Neville Island, Pennsylvania until 1984, [ 13 ] National Steel Corporation until 1992, Wean United as an independent until 1993 (still maintaining US headquarters in the city), Harbison Walker Refactories as an independent until 1967 (while still maintaining US headquarters in the city) and the still operational Allegheny Technologies and Ampco Pittsburgh . Bethlehem Steel , Republic Steel and LTV Steel also had large local operations. Other major mills of the area included: McKeesport Tube Works 1872–1987 [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Edgar Thomson Steel Works 1873–present Hays Army Ammunition Plant 1942-June 1971 Clairton Steel Works April 21, 1903 [ 16 ] -1984 [ 17 ] Duquesne Steel Works 1886 – October 1, 1984, employed as many as 9,000 persons in the 1940s.

Pressed Steel had as many as 12,000 employees. [ 23 ] Donora US Steel Wire mill -1966 4,500 employees [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] Monessen American Chain & Cable -1972 1,000 employees. [ 24 ] East Monongahela Liggett Spring & Axle -1978 350 employees. [ 24 ] McKeesport Ft. Pitt Steel Casting -1978 325 employees. [ 24 ] Hazelwood J&L Steel -1981 1,000 employees.

[ 24 ] Alcoa's New Kensington works 1893-March 1971 at its peak employed 3,300 workers on 75 acres under 1 million square feet of manufacturing space. [ 27 ] Alcoa's Logan Ferry Powder Works 1918–? Alcoa's Coal Mine (north of New Kensington) 1918–1923 [ 27 ] Carnegie's Union Railroad was founded in 1894 and is still in operation serving area steel mills. Twentieth century [ edit ] Pittsburgh Steel mill in Homestead circa 1907 In the early 20th century the economy of Pittsburgh was primarily driven by the steel industry and the city had reached a population 321,616. [ 28 ] Throughout this period, Pittsburgh would see a spike in population and a slow decline at the end of the century. At one point Pittsburgh was the eighth-largest city in America. [ citation needed ] In 1901, The Amalgamated Association of Iron, Steel and Tin Workers organized a general strike against the U.S. Steel Corporation subsidiaries, the first strike since 1892. [ 29 ] A 1903 Pittsburgh Press front page highlighted the city's being a focus point for three different railroads. [ 30 ] In 1911 the city was being referred to as the "Stogie capital of the nation" with several high quality cigar manufacturers located in the region.
