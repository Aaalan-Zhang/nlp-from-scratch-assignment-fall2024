Education accounts for almost 80% of high-wage jobs in Allegheny County. The Pittsburgh area has seen growth in other sectors as well. Professional services, finance and wholesale trade were among the growing sectors. However, much of this growth was outside the borders of Allegheny County. This was detrimental to the county of Allegheny; however, the growth in the outer nine counties helped to stabilize the loss of employment. With big events happening in Pittsburgh throughout the late 2000s, the tourism industry has flourished. The industry has created over 11,000 new jobs in the area, some 6,000 of them within Allegheny County. [ 44 ] Pittsburgh has long been a major finance and banking center. [ 45 ] Present situation [ edit ] Since 2009 Pittsburgh has hosted the annual DUG East Conference. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] "Total nonfarm employment, over-the-year percent change in the United States and the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, March 1999-2009" [ 48 ] The following is a list of the top ten private employers in Pittsburgh. [ 49 ] Rank Employer Number of Pittsburgh employees Product(s) 1 University of Pittsburgh Medical Center 40,600 Health care 2 University of Pittsburgh 12,600 Higher education 3 PNC Financial Services 9,200 Financial services 4 Allegheny Health Network 8,900 Health care 5 Giant Eagle 8,000 Supermarkets 6 Bank of New York Mellon 7,610 Financial services 7 Highmark 5,270 Health insurance 8 U.S. Steel 4,700 Steel manufacturing 9 Carnegie Mellon University 4,600 Higher education 10 Verizon Communications 3,750 Telecommunications Pittsburgh saw fewer effects of the 2008 economic recession than many other American cities. The city's transition from heavy dependence on the manufacturing industries to an economy based on health services, education, and innovative technologies kept Pittsburgh from the worst of the recession. The housing industry never saw the over-inflation rates other regions were dealing with as housing prices rose two percent in the last quarter of 2008, while other cities in the nation saw a much higher decline percentage. [ 50 ] In the period between 2006 and 2011, the Pittsburgh MSA experienced over 10% appreciation in housing prices—the highest appreciation out of the largest 25 MSAs in the United States. 22 of the top 25 MSAs saw a depreciation of housing values during the same period. [ 51 ] National non-profits [ edit ] Several national or global non-profits call Pittsburgh home including: Learning Disabilities Association of America (since 1963) [ 52 ] Institute for Research, Education and Training in Addictions [ 53 ] National Center for Juvenile Justice (since 1973) [ 54 ] Colcom Foundation (since 1996) Laurel Foundation (since 1951) Heinz Endowments Printing Industries of America (since 2003) Twenty-first-century progression [ edit ] The shifting economy of Pittsburgh has seen changes since the 1990s; these are primarily in banking, health care and technology. However, In December 2004, Pittsburgh was forced into an Act 47 because the finances in the city were down. In January 2003 Pittsburgh's unemployment rate reached 6.8%, but has seen a major decline in, as in April 2005 the rates were near only 4.8%. [ 55 ] Since one in every five jobs in Pittsburgh lies within the health care service, Pittsburgh was able to hold steady during the recent economic downturn . [ 56 ] [ 57 ] During this, the city also began to see growth in other occupations such as the business service and construction. The business service sectors in 2008 saw an increase of over 3,000 jobs. During the downturn, Pittsburgh still developed many parts of the city creating over 1,000 construction jobs in the region. [ 58 ] Technology industry [ edit ] Pittsburgh has established itself as a technology hub with such companies as Google , Apple Inc. , Intel , Uber , Facebook and RAND establishing campuses in the city. The Pittsburgh Technology Center , Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center and Pittsburgh LAN Coalition also develop major innovations. [ citation needed ] Companies such as Duolingo , Petrosoft, Modcloth , Guru.com , Songwhale and others have global headquarters in the city. The Crons company designs motivational athletic apparel. [ 59 ] 2009 G-20 Pittsburgh Summit [ edit ] Main article: 2009 G-20 Pittsburgh summit Pittsburgh was chosen to hold the 2009 G-20 summit for multiple reasons. Pittsburgh utilizes its past by building on previous successes in manufacturing, business services, and green energy. "Pittsburgh manufacturers employ almost 100,000 workers and the region is the second-largest market in the United States for metals industry employment." [ 60 ] Pittsburgh is also home to some of the world's largest business and financial services, which supply the greatest amount to the regional economic output. In the past, innovation in energy has been advanced through commercialization of oil, coal, and natural gas. More focus and attention is being given to the innovation in sustainability and efficiency while protecting the environment as Pittsburgh has more than 30 LEED certified buildings. [ 60 ] Economic development plan [ edit ] The State of Pennsylvania requires every county to develop a land use and growth management plan. Allegheny Places is the plan for Pittsburgh and Allegheny County. It was adopted in November 2008 and is a “unique blueprint for a sustainable future envisioned by the citizens of the County”. [ 61 ] The plan has a steering committee with over 100 members, an advisory committee with over 400 members, and a sounding board. The plan advocates a future in which: Equitable access to the opportunities and benefits of economic development to all residents is provided Former brownfields are transformed and developed Transit-oriented development efforts reduce road congestion and connect the major economic areas – Oakland, Downtown, and the Pittsburgh International Airport The promotion of greenways will link the community with parks, trails, riverfronts, etc. Affordable [ clarification needed ] and high-quality [ clarification needed ] housing exists for all A diversified economy provides stable, well-paying jobs [ 62 ] The economic development plan includes enterprise zones, research and technology developments, development of research parks, such as the University of Pittsburgh Applied Research Center , partnerships with economic development organizations, and venture capital initiatives. An Urban Enterprise Zone is a location within the inner city free from import duties, taxes, and some government regulations. [ 63 ] Studies of enterprise zones have shown increased job growth and investment. In the majority of studies, there is an apparent relationship between the creation of enterprise zones and increased economic activity in the zones. The zones also show economic activity not typical of the surrounding metropolitan area. [ 64 ] However, success is often questionable and subject to local conditions. [ 65 ] Allegheny County has 26 enterprise zones, in which 17 are in the City of Pittsburgh. [ 62 ] The research and technology sector is growing due to the local universities, medical centers, the technology cluster, and the provision of financial capital to fund its development. These attributes provide the specific infrastructure required of sought-after industries. [ 62 ] Therefore, this could attract business to the region and sustain or expand existing firms, which should result in a net increase in total jobs. However, this type of development is still fairly new, which means it is difficult to draw any noteworthy conclusions about its potential. Also, the presence of universities provides the context for university-industry technology transfers, which is the effective movement of technology to industry via students trained in detailed programs to meet the detailed wants of the industry. [ 66 ] Economic upward mobility [ edit ] According to a 2014 report published by the National Bureau of Economic Research , Pittsburgh is the second-best American city for intergenerational economic mobility; [ 67 ] in other words, Pittsburgh is the second best city to achieve the American Dream . [ 68 ] 2013 news [ edit ] As of early 2013 the largest property managers in the Pittsburgh area included CBRE Group , [ 69 ] Oxford Development , [ 70 ] RIDC [ 71 ] and Jones Lang Lasalle . [ 72 ] On August 13, 2013, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that the H. J. Heinz Company would lay off 350 office employees who work in the Pittsburgh area. After the layoff, the company will still have approximately 800 employees in the Pittsburgh area. [ 73 ] 2014 news [ edit ] Work is underway for an innovation roadmap for the city.
