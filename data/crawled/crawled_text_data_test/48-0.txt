If this sounds like you, don't worry because this guide has you covered. I've been to hundreds of shows in Pittsburgh at venues from bars to packed stadiums, and now I'm passing on that knowledge to you, fellow concert-goers. Join me for this exhaustive list of where to see live music in Pittsburgh and my tips and tricks for scoring tickets, where to sit, parking and much more: Pittsburgh Music Venue Map Mr. Smalls Once a Catholic church, Mr. Smalls is a top live music venue perched atop the Millvale neighborhood that can do it all. You can see national acts in their main theatre (capacity is about 800) in the main theater space of this eclectic venue, then head down the hallways to The Funhouse , a repurposed skatepark-turned-music-venue that seats 175. The acoustics in here are top-notch regardless of the type of band you're seeing, and everyone from Ziggy Marley and the Arctic Monkeys to GWAR and All That Remains have put on memorable shows at this truly one-of-a-kind venue. Pro Tips: After you buy your ticket, add on the Balcony Experience for a unique view of the show that can be scaled up from seated individual tickets to private rooms for you and your friends with bottle service. The food here (located on the second level near the balcony) is stellar and reasonably priced. Use the bar way in the back of the venue for the quickest way to get a beer and back to your seat. Gristhouse and Strange Roots are both within easy walking distance to grab a brew before or after the show. Roxian Theatre Roxian Theatre , which houses about 1,400, is similar in size to Mr. Smalls but with a completely different feel. This former McKees Rocks movie theater from the 1920s was completely gutted and modernized into a cutting-edge venue with unmatched sound and lighting for a venue of this size. Seats and standing room here are all GA, so plan on getting to this venue when the doors open, especially if you want to snag the best spots and sightlines for the show. Gleaming bars wrap around the main floor and mezzanine and often offer themed cocktails or other specials depending on the show you're seeing. I've been here for electronic, indie, rock and punk shows, and am always wowed by how good bands sound here and how good my photos look. Pro Tips: Get the parking pass or Uber. It can be difficult to find street parking in this neighborhood, so save yourself the headache. Also, look into the Roxbox ticket upgrade for a front row seat guaranteed on the main, elevated floor. Club Cafe Many music venues have come and gone over the years in the happening nightlife neighborhood of the South Side (RIP Rex Theater) but Club Cafe has outlasted them all. The secret sauce? This intimate (seating for MAYBE 125 max) venue is intensely dedicated to bringing in national touring acts on an almost nightly basis. Add in the cheap cost of tickets (most around $15-18), a stellar list of local drafts and creative cocktails, and this is the perfect night out. Pro Tips: Get there when the doors open and try to snag a seat as close to the stage as possible for the best, unobstructed views of the show. Bar seating makes it easy to get drinks, but likely you'll be peering around peeps to see the stage. Leave your coats in the car. Thunderbird Café and Music Hall Another two-venues-in-one destination, Thunderbird Café and Music Hall in Lawrenceville rises higher on my list of favorite venues every time I see a show there. I'm in love with their Front Porch Stage, a completely stripped down stage made of recycled materials which features local acts, national musicians and a Bluegrass Night on Tuesdays. Up top, their 380 capacity venue has a surprisingly large stage as well as multiple bars as you enjoy indie, blues, jazz and funk among many other niche genres. Pro Tip: If you prefer to sit for shows, look for the Lower Balcony ticket for shows in the larger Music Hall venue. Not only do you get seats, you get access to your own private bar. The smaller stage has plenty of seating throughout. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Skinny Lister (@skinnylister) Spirit Have you noticed a theme yet? Spirit , also in Lawrenceville, is split into two spectacular live music venues raised from the dead of a former Moose lodge. Both the first floor Lodge and second floor Hall have full stages and sound great no matter where you're standing. Sometimes, events may sprawl between both levels with large parties for holidays or other special occasions filling both venues with DJs, emo, soul and plenty of other genres. Pro Tip: The food here is great - snag a pizza or plenty of vegan options. Be sure to take a walk around the venue before you go in to see their mural covering the space, which is painted fresh each year with a new design. City Winery Pittsburgh Although City Winery in The Terminal might look like a small wine shop and dining area from the street, through the giant double doors lies the true treasure of this spot, a world-class entertainment venue. I've now seen live podcasts, music acts and comedy shows here, and this is quickly becoming one of my regular hangouts. Why? City Winery does it all, and does it all exceptionally well. The ambience, seated at modern tables in front of an elegant stage and surrounded by wine casks, is completely unique. The food menu is sprawling and delivered fresh to your table the second it is ready, so you can snack throughout the show. Oh, and the wine is great, too (I especially like their pinot noir). Plus, I never even have to leave my seat to get topped off with another glass. Pro Tip: When ordering your tickets, select the option to Have a Bottle of Wine Waiting At Your Table. It's that easy and doesn't require upfront payment. Then you can find your seats and immediately start sipping before the lights dim. Carnegie of Homestead Music Hall While many of the live music venues on this list have been old buildings reimagined into new spaces, Carnegie of Homestead is still serving its original purpose as a library, athletic facility and a grand concert hall to Homestead and surrounding neighborhoods. Seating around 1,000, at this stunning venue you'll be able to grab a drink, walk around a gorgeous library and then settle into your seats for the show in the opulent hall. I've seen everything from comedy acts to classic rock groups here, and am always pleasantly surprised at how amazing all types of music and performances sound in this 100+ year-old venue. Pro Tips: Bring a seat cushion, these seats can get a little uncomfortable. Balcony seating is lovely here, but be aware that seats on the left and right side face inwards towards the center of the venue, so you may need to watch the performance looking at an angle. The Mr. Roboto Project No frills and all about the music. Located on Penn Ave, this intimate and inclusive space has a great atmosphere, punk vibes and a simple raised stage to catch up-and-coming and local bands tear it up.
