In 1902 the top players in the area, mainly from the Duquesne Country and Athletic Club line-up, formed the Pittsburgh Stars of the first National Football League . The Stars were suspected of being financed by Barney Dreyfuss and William Chase Temple , the owners of baseball's Pittsburgh Pirates. The team featured baseball players in the line-up including Christy Mathewson , a future Hall of Fame pitcher with the New York Giants and Fred Crolius , and outfielder with Pirates. The team won the league's only championship in 1902. In 1933, as the oldest of nine children Art Rooney , who had been raised on the North Side of Pittsburgh, founded the Pittsburgh Steelers . [ 30 ] Originally nicknamed the Pirates, [ 31 ] the team later changed their name to the Steelers, to represent the city's heritage of producing steel . The Steelers' first season with a winning record came in 1942. However, they lost their first playoff game in 1947. [ 32 ] In 1969, the Steelers hired head coach Chuck Noll who strategically drafted players in order to improve the team. [ 33 ] Three years later, in the first playoff game at Three Rivers Stadium Pittsburgh's rookie running back Franco Harris returned an errant pass that bounced off an opposing player for a game-winning touchdown in a play that later became labeled the Immaculate Reception . In 1974, the Steelers won their first Super Bowl in franchise history—a feat which they would repeat in 1975, 1978, and 1979 to become the first NFL franchise to win four Super Bowls. In 1992, Noll was succeeded by Bill Cowher , who led the franchise to its fifth Super Bowl victory in 2005. Mike Tomlin succeeded Cower and led the Steelers to an NFL record sixth Super Bowl victory in 2008. [ 32 ] As of 2009, the Steelers have 18 members in the Pro Football Hall of Fame . [ 34 ] In October 1964, Ernie Stautner , who played on the Steelers from 1950 to 1963, became the only Steelers' player to have his number— 70 —retired. [ 35 ] Charles "Mean Joe" Greene had his number -75- retired in 2014. In 2008, ESPN.com ranked Steelers' fans as the best in the NFL, citing their "unbelievable" sellout streak of 299 consecutive games. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] Steelers Chairman Dan Rooney , son of founder Art Rooney, became the majority owner of the Steelers in November 2008 along with his son Art II, after they bought all of the shares of two of his four brothers. [ 38 ] Outside of the NFL, the city was represented by the Pittsburgh Americans of the second American Football League in 1936 and 1937. It was also briefly represented by the Pittsburgh Maulers of the United States Football League , in 1984, and the Pittsburgh Gladiators (which later became the Tampa Bay Storm ), of the Arena Football League from 1987 until 1990. A second Arena Football League team, the Pittsburgh Power , played in the Consol Energy Center from 2011 until 2014. [ 39 ] In addition, Pittsburgh has also been home to women's full-contact football teams. The Pittsburgh Passion were founded in 2002 as members of the National Women's Football Association , then played in the Independent Women's Football League , and then Women's Football Alliance . [ 40 ] The Passion play their home games at West Allegheny High School in nearby Imperial . The team went 12–0 and won a national title in 2007 as members of the NWFA. [ 41 ] The Pittsburgh Rebellion were members of the Legends Football League during the 2017 season with home games at the downtown Highmark Stadium . The "most established area minor-league football team" the Pittsburgh Colts are members of the North American Football League 's Regional American Football League.

[ 45 ] The Riverhounds are one of the oldest professional soccer clubs in the United States operating outside of MLS; the only two older clubs are fellow USL Championship side Charleston Battery and USL League One's Richmond Kickers , both of which were founded in 1993. Like their counterparts, the Steelers, Penguins and Pirates, the Riverhounds are a full-time professional club, and many of their current and former players have represented their countries in international play. In 2024, the USL W League announced that the Riverhounds' ownership group had established a women's team to begin competing in 2025. [ 46 ] Several months later, the club's name, Pittsburgh Riveters SC , and crest were unveiled. [ 47 ] Historic teams such as the suburban Harmarville Hurricanes won the U.S. Open Cup , U.S. Soccer's national championship, with Harmarville winning in 1952 and 1956 and reaching the final in 1953. Pittsburgh area teams Gallatin and Morgan Strasser also won the Open Cup in its earlier years, but since the end of the 1950s, only the Riverhounds have advanced as far as the quarterfinals, which they achieved in 2001 and 2023. The amateur club Pittsburgh Beadling has contested for regional and national titles for over 100 years, winning the National Amateur Cup in 1954, [ 48 ] though Beadling now operates primarily as a youth club. Aldo Donelli , better known as a Duquesne University Football player and coach played soccer with a number of clubs in the 1920s and 1930s and was a member of the United States men's national soccer team during the 1934 FIFA World Cup. He is a member of the National Soccer Hall of Fame. In a 4–2 qualifying victory over Mexico in Rome, Italy on May 24, he tallied all four times, becoming the first American to score his first three international goals with the senior team in the same match. The region's interest in soccer continues as modern stars such as natives Justin Evans , Meghan Klingenberg , Don Malinowski , John Stollmeyer , A. J. Wood and Marvell Wynne II have all achieved international success. Rugby [ edit ] The Pittsburgh Forge Rugby Club are rugby union team based in South Side Pittsburgh .
