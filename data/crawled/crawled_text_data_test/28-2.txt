The first successful 3 wheeled buggies were developed in the early 80s led by Pi Kappa Alpha (PiKA) and Sigma Nu. Development of two wheeled buggies [ 13 ] by Delta Upsilon from 1986–1989 continued the theme of wheel alignment. In 1988, Delta Upsilon [ 14 ] broke the course record with a time of 2:08.5 [ 15 ] –  a record that stood only briefly as SPIRIT surpassed that time later that day and further lowered the record time the following day. Two wheeled buggies were later eliminated from competition for safety reasons through modifications to the rules. PiKA and SPIRIT took every Sweepstakes championship from 1986 until 2000 when SDC won the women's race and 2001 when Fringe won the men's race. PiKA continued its success in the 2000s, setting the consecutive wins record by winning for seven years in a row (2002–2008). SDC took the title in the men's race in 2009 breaking PiKA's streak and setting a new record. Fringe took the men's title in 2010 after a dominant SDC was removed from competition due to an alleged fire safety violation. Fringe took the men's title again in 2011 in beating SDC A by 1 second, with SDC B and C teams taking 3rd and 4th, while SDC reclaimed the Women's title. [ 16 ] The defending men's champion is SDC with eight consecutive wins from 2012 through 2019, which is the record for most wins in a row. The current women's title is also held by SDC (2017, 2018 and 2019). Live media coverage of the Sweepstakes races has historically been provided by WRCT-FM , the school's student-run radio station. In recent years, campus television station cmuTV has broadcast live video coverage of the races with commentary from WRCT-FM. In the fall of 2008 the Buggy Alumni Association [ 17 ] was founded to preserve the history of the sport, assist with keeping alumni connected to the event and assist the current students in maintaining the race's continuing existence. The race videos are available on DVD from cmuTV after the races end. Midway [ edit ] A booth in Carnegie Mellon University's 2013 Booth Competition, a part of the spring Carnival For Carnival Weekend, the College of Fine Arts parking lot is turned into "Midway." Midway features both booths and carnival rides. Booths are multi-story structures constructed by campus organizations, featuring (usually) free games and cheap giveaway prizes. The booths are intricate, multi-level affairs, showing off the creativity and energy of the students who construct them. The Friday of the week before Carnival is known as "Move On", and is when all the organizations who are building booths move their supplies, materials, tools, and pre-fabricated components onto Midway. Build week commences from that Friday night, and for the entire week, organizations steadfastly build their booths, preparing for the official opening of Midway at 3:00 pm the following Thursday. Each year, an overall theme for booths is chosen. Booth has four competitive categories. These include: fraternity, sorority, independent, and blitz (smaller booths). Each organization chooses a sub-theme and builds their booth accordingly. The construction of these booths is a competition and each booth is judged on various criteria, including both daytime and nighttime appearance, adherence to theme, game playability, environmentalism, and appropriateness of prizes. Midway also features portable carnival rides that are brought in and set up, along with standard carnival concession food. Various musical acts, improv comedy troupes, and other performances are staged in a nearby tent running throughout the weekend and providing a backdrop to the entire spectacle. Mobot [ edit ] A mobot approaches the end of the course, with Hamerschlag Hall in the background. "Mobot," a general term resulting from shortening "mobile robot", is an annual competition at Carnegie Mellon that made its debut in 1994. In this event, robots try (autonomously) to pass through gates, in order, and reach the finish line. There is a white line on the pavement connecting the gates, and the line is normally used to find the gates, though it is not mandated by the rules that the robots follow the line. Towards the end of the course, the lines split and merge randomly, and knowledge of which line leads to the next gate is needed to consistently finish the course. This information is provided by the judges shortly before the actual competition begins. The current undergraduate mobot course record of 1:17:10 is held by Nathaniel Barshay for his entry "AEPi" which competed in 2010. The overall mobot course record of 33.99 seconds is held by a Michael Licitra and Jeff McMahill set in 2009. In Carnival fashion, awards are presented to overall winners. The rewards are as follows: First Place ($1000), Second Place ($500), Third Place ($250), Open Class ($250), Judges' Choice ($100), Course Record ($250), and MoboJoust ($100). [ 18 ] Entry to compete in the Mobot competition is free and is for currently enrolled undergraduate students at Carnegie Mellon. The Mobot Competition is run and organized by the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. Kiltie Band [ edit ] The Kiltie Band is the concert and marching band of Carnegie Mellon University , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , United States. It is known for wearing kilts , in recognition of the Scottish-American ancestry of Andrew Carnegie , the founder of the university. As of 2021, the band's director is Carnegie Mellon and Kiltie alumnus Jeremy Olisar. [ 19 ] The previous director, serving the band for 38 years, was music professor Paul Gerlach. [ 19 ] The band was formed in 1908 with seven members and has grown to more than 130 members. [ 20 ] The band took the field for its first official performance on November 25, 1922 on what would have been Andrew Carnegie's 87th birthday. [ 21 ] Until 1957, the band was male only, but in that year a female flutist joined and by 1961 there were eleven young women in the band. [ 22 ] In the early nineties the band, under the direction of Paul Gerlach who was known as the Director For Life without the Possibility for Parole, started a new tradition within the band. Drawing inspiration from the critically acclaimed 1975 film, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, a trumpeter of the band (Ray Strobel), wrote an arrangement of King Arthur's Quest for the band. To this day, a King takes to the track every home game between the third and fourth quarters, to quest for the Grail, with his loyal steed, Patsy. [ 21 ] The Kiltie Marching Band consists of musicians and colorguard and plays at all Carnegie Mellon home football games. There is a new show every week with music ranging from traditional marches and oldies to current pop tunes and jazz standards. After football season, the Kiltie Concert Band plays a holiday concert and two spring concerts, including a performance at Carnegie Mellon’s Spring Carnival. Additionally, a part of the band gets together and acts as a pep band for the basketball teams. Membership is open to all members of the campus/community without audition. Participants must do their best to promote the success of the ensemble through attendance, attitude, and dependability.
