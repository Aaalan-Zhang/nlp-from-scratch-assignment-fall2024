Roads and infrastructure [ edit ] The high number of freeze/thaw cycles during the winter is sometimes blamed for the difficulty of maintaining local roads. Streets [ edit ] A 1795 map of Pittsburgh Pittsburgh is home to several notable streets. Roslyn Place is a small wooden-paved cul-de-sac located in the Shadyside neighborhood of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . The street was built in 1914 in the Nicolson Pavement style and is home to the historic Roslyn Place district . Canton Avenue is the steepest officially recorded public street in the United States . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] East Carson Street has one of the largest concentrations of 19th-century homes, which has prompted outsiders to call the neighborhood the City's Georgetown . [ 4 ] It includes many bars and restaurants as well as residences. Grant Street is the main government and business corridor in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . It is home to the global headquarters of U.S. Steel , Koppers Chemicals , Federated Investors , and Oxford Development . It also is home to the seat of Allegheny County , City of Pittsburgh and the regional Federal Government offices. It is part of the Pittsburgh Central Downtown Historic District . Expressways [ edit ] Map showing major highways in Pittsburgh and its surrounding region The main highway connecting Pittsburgh to the Pennsylvania Turnpike ( I-76 ) on the east is I-376 , known to locals as the "Parkway East." It includes the locally-notorious Squirrel Hill interchange, where unusual traffic patterns and the adjoining tunnel often cause traffic congestion. Several accidents have involved tall trucks getting stuck against the tunnel roof. Also part of I-376 is the "Parkway West," which leads from downtown Pittsburgh to the Pittsburgh International Airport 's main terminal and leads into the contiguous Airport Parkway and Southern Expressway. I-279 , known as the "Parkway North," runs north of the city to merge with I-79 . It connects the city with the North Hills and the Cranberry area. There is no "Parkway South". I-579 , or the "Crosstown Boulevard," is a spur off of I-279 that alleviates downtown and North Shore traffic headed north or south and to events at either the convention center or the PPG Paints Arena . North of the city, the Parkway North and a short section of Interstate 579 over the Veterans Bridge have reversible high occupancy vehicle HOV lanes for rush-hour commuting, which require a minimum of two occupants per vehicle for use; no electric/hybrid vehicle "HOV OK" program has yet been made available. On August 25, 1995, six people were killed in a head-on collision on the HOV lanes after PennDOT employee William Dean Snyder failed to follow procedures. Snyder maintained open the traffic gates for both directions simultaneously. I-579 running through downtown Pittsburgh I-376 approaching Downtown Pittsburgh Belt system [ edit ] Allegheny County Belt System Main article: Allegheny County Belt System Unlike many other major U.S. cities, Pittsburgh lacks a dedicated contiguous beltway surrounding the city. I-76 ( Pennsylvania Turnpike ), I-79 , and I-70 form a roughly triangular-shaped "beltway," but the distance of these roads from the city center and the need to exit and enter each leg in order to continue circling the city render them impractical as a beltway; commuters are forced to use secondary roads to go from suburb to suburb. The Allegheny County Belt System is an attempt at dealing with this without building additional infrastructure. The Pittsburgh Wayfinder System is a similar system that aims to guide travelers to popular destinations and services in the city proper. Green Belt on PA 837 Dual Blue and Green Belt signage Bridges and tunnels [ edit ] Main articles: List of bridges of Pittsburgh and List of tunnels in Pittsburgh Pittsburgh is a city of bridges: over 2,000 bridges dot the landscape of Allegheny County. The southern entrance to Downtown is through the Fort Pitt Tunnel and then over the Fort Pitt Bridge . [ 5 ] The Panhandle Bridge , a former railroad bridge, carries Pittsburgh Regional Transit's Blue and Red (formerly 42S/47L) light rail lines across the Monongahela River . Other notable bridges are Fort Duquesne Bridge , the Liberty Bridge , and The Three Sisters . [ citation needed ] Notable tunnels include two interstate highway tunnels on I-376 , Fort Pitt Tunnel and Squirrel Hill Tunnel ; major traffic tunnels Armstrong Tunnel and Liberty Tunnels ; the light rail tunnel, Mt. Washington Transit Tunnel , the Schenley Tunnel , the Wabash Tunnel and Corliss Tunnel . [ citation needed ] At least 15 of Pittsburgh's bridges are visible in this aerial photo. Liberty Tunnels Regional mass transit [ edit ] Main article: Pittsburgh Regional Transit Local public transportation is coordinated by Pittsburgh Regional Transit , the 14th-largest urban mass transit system in the United States . It services 730 square miles (1,900 km 2 ), including all of Allegheny County and portions of Armstrong , Beaver , Washington , and Westmoreland counties. [ 6 ] PRT maintains a network of intracity bus routes, two inclines on Mt. Washington above Downtown (mostly a tourist attraction rather than a means of commuting), and a light rail / busway system. The transit agency discontinued its commuter rail system, the PATrain , in 1989, However, A New Line To Arnold Has Been Proposed Since 2009. Pittsburgh Light Rail [ edit ] A light rail vehicle departs Station Square and prepares to enter the Mount Washington Transit Tunnel . Main articles: Pittsburgh Light Rail , Red Line (Pittsburgh) , Blue Line (Pittsburgh) , and Silver Line (Pittsburgh) The light rail network is a direct descendant of the original streetcar system , which once numbered dozens of lines and included interurban routes to neighboring cities such as Washington and Charleroi . The current network comprises five routes on 25 miles (40 km) of track, operated by modern articulated light rail vehicles . Although most is on dedicated right-of-way, including the Mt. Washington Transit Tunnel , trains still street run in the Beechview neighborhood. Once across the Monongahela River trains enter a subway to serve Downtown Pittsburgh . Since March 2012, the North Shore Connector has extended service across the Allegheny River, via tunnel, to such destinations as PNC Park , Heinz Field , and Rivers Casino . Blue Line train Red Line train Steel Plaza station Pittsburgh Bus Rapid Transit [ edit ] Herron station on the East Busway Main articles: Pittsburgh Regional Transit § Bus rapid transit , South Busway , Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway , and West Busway PAT operates over 800 buses on both standard routes and bus rapid transit routes in Allegheny County. The latter use high-speed articulated buses that run at grade and above ground on their own right-of-way with platform stations, much like a rail system. In some instances, such as the Mount Washington tunnel, these buses travel along paved sections of the light rail line. There are currently three routes: the South Busway , from downtown to the southern part of Allegheny County, the Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway , from the Amtrak station to the eastern suburbs, and the West Busway , to the western suburbs. Future plans include extending the West Busway to the Pittsburgh International Airport . All light rail/busway stations outside the downtown have PAT station shuttles that serve the surrounding neighborhoods, and sections of the metropolitan area not served by the light rail/busway system, including most of the northern suburbs, have regular PAT bus routes. The mass transit systems of Beaver , Fayette , Lawrence , Washington , and Westmoreland counties (including Mid Mon Valley Transit Authority ) operate their own commuter shuttles to and from the city; the private company Myers Coach Line operates commuter service from Butler County. [ 7 ] The mass transit system of Monongalia County, West Virginia also provides connections to Pittsburgh. In early 2005 the Southwestern Pennsylvania Commission proposed combining Pittsburgh Regional Transit, then known as Port Authority, with the nine surrounding metro counties transit agencies.
