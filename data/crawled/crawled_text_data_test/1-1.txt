[ 8 ] Chartier's Town was a Shawnee town established in 1734 by Peter Chartier . Kittanning was a Lenape and Shawnee village on the Allegheny, with an estimated 300–400 residents. [ 9 ] Early colonization (1747–1763) [ edit ] British and French Forts, 1753–1758, and the routes of the two British campaigns to take the forks of the Ohio The first Europeans arrived in the 1710s as traders. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a manuscript in 1717, and later that year European traders established posts and settlements in the area. [ 10 ] Europeans first began to settle in the region in 1748, when the first Ohio Company , a Virginian land speculation company, won a grant of 200,000 acres (800 km 2 ) in the upper Ohio Valley. From a post at present-day Cumberland, Maryland , the company began to construct an 80-mile (130 km) wagon road to the Monongahela River [ 11 ] employing a Lenape Indian chief named Nemacolin and a party of settlers headed by Capt. Michael Cresap to begin widening the track into a road. It mostly followed the same route as an existing Native American trail [ 12 ] now known as Nemacolin's Trail . The river crossing and flats at Redstone creek , was the earliest point and shortest distance for the descent of a wagon road. Later in the war, the site fortified as Fort Burd (now Brownsville ) was one of several possible destinations. Another alternative was the divergent route that became Braddock's Road a few years later through present-day New Stanton . In the event, the colonists did not succeed in turning the path into a wagon road much beyond the Cumberland Narrows pass before they came into conflict with Native Americans. The colonists later mounted a series of expeditions in order to accomplish piecemeal improvements to the track. The nearby Native American community of Logstown was an important trade and council center in the Ohio Valley. [ 6 ] Between June 15 and November 10, 1749, an expedition headed by Celeron de Bienville , a French officer, traveled down the Allegheny and Ohio to bolster the French claim to the region. [ 12 ] De Bienville warned away British traders and posted markers claiming the territory. [ 13 ] In 1753, Marquis Duquesne , the Governor of New France , sent another, larger expedition. At present-day Erie, Pennsylvania , an advance party built Fort Presque Isle . They also cut a road through the woods and built Fort Le Boeuf on French Creek , from which it was possible at high water to float to the Allegheny. By summer, an expedition of 1,500 French and Native American men descended the Allegheny. Some wintered at the confluence of French Creek and the Allegheny. The following year, they built Fort Machault at that site. [ 14 ] Alarmed at these French incursions in the Ohio Valley, Governor Dinwiddie of Virginia sent Major George Washington to warn the French to withdraw. [ 15 ] Accompanied by Christopher Gist , Washington arrived at the Forks of the Ohio on November 25, 1753. George Washington 's sketch of Monongahela River, Allegheny River (named as the upper Ohio), and French Creek that accompanied his journal (1753) in which he recorded his impressions: [ 16 ] As I got down before the Canoe, I spent some Time in viewing the Rivers, & the Land in the Fork, which I think extremely well situated for a Fort; as it has the absolute Command of both Rivers. The Land at the Point is 20 or 25 feet (7.6 m) above the common Surface of the Water; & a considerable Bottom of flat well timber'd Land all around it, very convenient for Building. Proceeding up the Allegheny, Washington presented Dinwiddie's letter to the French commanders first at Venango, and then Fort Le Boeuf . The French officers received Washington with wine and courtesy, but did not withdraw. [ 15 ] Governor Dinwiddie sent Captain William Trent to build a fort at the Forks of the Ohio. On February 17, 1754, Trent began construction of the fort, the first European habitation [ 17 ] at the site of present-day Pittsburgh . The fort, named Fort Prince George , was only half-built by April 1754, when over 500 French forces arrived and ordered the 40-some colonials back to Virginia. The French tore down the British fortification and constructed Fort Duquesne . [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Governor Dinwiddie launched another expedition. Colonel Joshua Fry commanded the regiment with his second-in-command, George Washington, leading an advance column. On May 28, 1754, Washington's unit clashed with the French in the Battle of Jumonville Glen , during which 13 French soldiers were killed and 21 were taken prisoner. [ 18 ] After the battle, Washington's ally, Seneca chief Tanaghrisson , unexpectedly executed the French commanding officer, Ensign Joseph Coulon de Jumonville . The French pursued Washington and on July 3, 1754, George Washington surrendered following the Battle of Fort Necessity . These frontier actions contributed to the start of the French and Indian War (1754–1763), or, the Seven Years' War , a global confrontation between Britain and France fought in both hemispheres. [ 15 ] [ 19 ] The Fort Pitt Blockhouse , dating to 1764, is the oldest structure in Pittsburgh. [ 15 ] In 1755, the Braddock Expedition was launched, accompanied by Virginia militia officer George Washington . Two regiments marched from Fort Cumberland across the Allegheny Mountains and into western Pennsylvania. Following a path Washington surveyed, over 3,000 men built a wagon road 12 feet (3.7 m) wide, that when complete, was the first road to cross the Appalachian Mountains . Braddock's Road , as it was known, blazed the way for the future National Road (US40). The expedition crossed the Monongahela River on July 9, 1755. French troops from Fort Duquesne ambushed Braddock's expedition at Braddock's Field , nine miles (14 km) from Fort Duquesne. [ 20 ] In the Battle of the Monongahela , the French inflicted heavy losses on the British, and Braddock was mortally wounded. [ 21 ] The surviving British and colonial forces retreated. This left the French and their Native American allies with dominion over the upper Ohio valley. [ 15 ] On September 8, 1756, an expedition of 300 militiamen destroyed the Shawnee and Lenape village of Kittanning , and in the summer of 1758, British Army officer John Forbes began a campaign to capture Fort Duquesne. [ 21 ] At the head of 7,000 regular and colonial troops, Forbes built Fort Ligonier and Fort Bedford , from where he cut a wagon road over the Allegheny Mountains, later known as Forbes' Road. On the night of September 13–14, 1758, an advance column under Major James Grant was annihilated in the Battle of Fort Duquesne . [ 21 ] The battleground, the high hill east of the Point, was named Grant's Hill in his memory. With this defeat, Forbes decided to wait until spring. But when he heard that the French had lost Fort Frontenac and largely evacuated Fort Duquesne , he planned an immediate attack. Hopelessly outnumbered, the French abandoned and razed Fort Duquesne. Forbes occupied the burned fort on November 25, 1758, and ordered the construction of Fort Pitt , named after British Secretary of State William Pitt the Elder . He also named the settlement between the rivers, "Pittsborough" (see Etymology of Pittsburgh ). [ 11 ] [ 15 ] The British garrison at Fort Pitt made substantial improvements to its fortification. [ 11 ] The French never attacked Fort Pitt and the war soon ended with the Treaty of Paris and French defeat. [ 15 ] They ceded their territories east of the Mississippi River.
