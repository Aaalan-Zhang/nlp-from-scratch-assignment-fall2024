Fifth Avenue was dubbed "Millionaire's Row" because of the many mansions lining the street. On March 17 and 18, 1936, Pittsburgh suffered the worst flood in its history, with flood levels peaking at 46 feet. This catastrophe killed 69 victims, destroyed thousands of buildings, caused $3B (2006 dollars) in damages, and put more than 60,000 steelworkers out of work. [ 57 ] High culture [ edit ] Oakland became the city's predominant cultural and educational center, including three universities, multiple museums, a library, a music hall, and a botanical conservatory. Oakland's University of Pittsburgh erected what today is still the world's fourth-tallest educational building, the 42-story Cathedral of Learning . [ 58 ] It towered over Forbes Field , where the Pittsburgh Pirates played from 1909 to 1970. [ 39 ] Downtown Pittsburgh panorama, from 1920. New immigrants and migrants [ edit ] Between 1870 and 1920, the population of Pittsburgh grew almost sevenfold, with a large number of European immigrants arriving to the city. New arrivals continue to come from Britain, Ireland, and Germany, but the most popular sources after 1870 were poor rural areas in southern and eastern Europe, including Italy, the Balkans, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the Russian Empire. Unskilled immigrants found jobs in construction, mining, steel mills and factories. They introduced new traditions, languages, and cultures to the city, creating a diversified society as a result. Ethnic neighborhoods developed in working-class areas and were built on densely populated hillsides and valleys, such as South Side , Polish Hill , Bloomfield , and Squirrel Hill , home to 28% of the city's almost 21,000 Jewish households. [ 59 ] The Strip District , the city's produce distribution center, still boasts many restaurants and clubs that showcase these multicultural traditions of Pittsburghers. [ 39 ] African Americans [ edit ] Further information: Great Migration (African American) The years 1916–1940 marked the largest migration of African Americans to Pittsburgh during the Great Migration from the rural South to industrial cities of the Northeast and Midwest. These migrants came for industrial jobs, education, political and social freedom, and to escape racial oppression and violence in the South. Migrants going to Pittsburgh and surrounding mill towns faced racial discrimination and restricted housing and job opportunities. The black population in Pittsburgh jumped from 6,000 in 1880 to 27,000 in 1910. Many took highly paid, skilled jobs in the steel mills. Pittsburgh's black population increased to 37,700 in 1920 (6.4% of the total) while the black element in Homestead, Rankin, Braddock, and others nearly doubled. They succeeded in building effective community responses that enabled the survival of new communities. [ 60 ] [ 61 ] Historian Joe Trotter explains the decision process: Although African-Americans often expressed their views of the Great Migration in biblical terms and received encouragement from northern black newspapers, railroad companies, and industrial labor agents, they also drew upon family and friendship networks to help in the move to Western Pennsylvania. They formed migration clubs, pooled their money, bought tickets at reduced rates, and often moved ingroups. Before they made the decision to move, they gathered information and debated the pros and cons of the process....In barbershops, poolrooms, and grocery stores, in churches, lodge halls, and clubhouses, and in private homes, southern blacks discussed, debated, and decided what was good and what was bad about moving to the urban North. [ 62 ] The newly established Black communities nearly all endured, apart from Johnstown where blacks were expelled in 1923. Joe Trotter explains how the Blacks built new institutions for their new communities in the Pittsburgh area: Black churches, fraternal orders, and newspapers (especially the Pittsburgh Courier ); organizations such as the NAACP, Urban League, and Garvey Movement; social clubs, restaurants, and baseball teams; hotels, beauty shops, barber shops, and taverns, all proliferated. [ 63 ] The cultural nucleus of Black Pittsburgh was Wylie Avenue in the Hill District . It became  an important jazz mecca because jazz greats such as Duke Ellington and Pittsburgh natives Billy Strayhorn and Earl Hines played there. Two of the Negro League's greatest baseball rivals, the Pittsburgh Crawfords and the Homestead Grays , often competed in the Hill District. The teams dominated the Negro National League in the 1930s and 1940s. [ 39 ] 1930s [ edit ] Pittsburgh was a Republican stronghold starting in the 1880s, [ 64 ] and the Republican governments provided jobs and assistance for the new immigrants in return for their votes. But the Great Depression starting in 1929 ruined the GOP in the city. The Democratic victory of 1932 meant an end to Republican patronage jobs and assistance. As the Depression worsened, Pittsburgh ethnics voted heavily for the Democrats, especially in 1934, making the city a stronghold of the New Deal Coalition . By 1936, Democratic programs for relief and jobs, especially the WPA , were so popular with the ethnics that a large majority voted for the Democrats. [ 65 ] [ 66 ] Joseph Guffey , statewide leader of the Democrats, and his local lieutenant David Lawrence gained control of all federal patronage in Pittsburgh after Roosevelt's landslide victory in 1932 and the election of a Democratic mayor in 1933. Guffey and Lawrence used the New Deal programs to increase their political power and build up a Democratic machine that superseded the decaying Republican machine. Guffey acknowledged that a high rate of people on relief was not only "a challenge" but also "an opportunity." He regarded each relief job as Democratic patronage. [ 67 ] 1940s [ edit ] Pittsburgh was at the center of the " Arsenal of Democracy " that provided steel, aluminum, munitions and machinery for the U.S. during World War II . Pittsburgh's mills contributed 95 million tons of steel to the war effort. The increased production output created a workforce shortage, which resulted in African Americans moving en masse during the Second Great Migration from the South to the city in order to find work. [ 11 ] Postwar [ edit ] David Lawrence , a Democrat, served as mayor of Pittsburgh from 1946 to 1959 and as Pennsylvania's governor from 1959 to 1963. [ 68 ] Lawrence used his political power to transform Pittsburgh's  political machine into a modern governmental unit that could run the city well and honestly. [ 69 ] In 1946  Lawrence decided to enforce the Smoke Control Ordinance of 1941 because he believed smoke abatement was crucial for the city's future economic development. However, enforcement placed a substantial burden on the city's working-class because smoky bituminous coal was much less expensive than smokeless fuels. One round of protests came from Italian-American organizations, which called for delay in enforcing it. Enforcement raised their cost of living and threatened the jobs of their relatives in nearby bituminous coal mines. Despite dislike of the smoke abatement program, Italian Americans strongly supported the reelection of Lawrence in 1949, in part because many of them were on the city payroll.

For the basketball team, see Pittsburgh Rens . The multi-purpose Three Rivers Stadium was built in 1970 as part of the Renaissance I project. It was imploded in 2001. Rich and productive, Pittsburgh was also the "Smoky City," with smog sometimes so thick that streetlights burned during the day [ 11 ] as well as rivers that resembled open sewers. Civic leaders, notably Mayor David L. Lawrence , elected in 1945, Richard K. Mellon , chairman of Mellon Bank and John P. Robin [ 71 ] [ 72 ] began smoke control and urban revitalization, also known as Urban Renewal projects that transformed the city [ 11 ] in unforeseen ways. "Renaissance I" began in 1946. Title One of the Housing Act of 1949 provided the means in which to begin. By 1950, vast swaths of buildings and land near the Point were demolished for Gateway Center . 1953 saw the opening of the (since demolished) Greater Pittsburgh Municipal Airport terminal . [ 27 ] In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the lower Hill District , an area inhabited predominantly by poor Blacks, was completely destroyed. Ninety-five acres of the lower Hill District were cleared using eminent domain , forcibly displacing hundreds of small businesses and more than 8,000 people (1,239 black families, 312 white), to make room for a cultural center that included the Civic Arena , which opened in 1961.
