While Penguins hockey is usually taking the ice inside, PPG Paints Arena easily converts into a home for Monster Jam, Disney on Ice, WWE and a fantastic lineup of stadium touring music acts, seating 15-20k depending on where the stage is. Trans-Siberian Orchestra always puts on a spectacle here yearly (I like to sit on the sides so I don't miss a thing) while the rest of the acts include classics like the Boss and Iron Maiden to Fallout Boy, Travis Scott and Greta Van Fleet. Pro Tip: With a newly upgraded sound system, PPG now has the best audio fidelity for any venue this size. Any excuse to add Blink 182 to my blog is a good one <3 Petersen Events Center The home of Pitt DI Basketball doubles as a 9,000+ seat venue for live music, and no matter which artist I've seen there, this place never disappoints. Despite being almost double the size of Stage AE, it still manages to feel like you're close to the artist no matter where you sit, and the venue lends itself to some of the more creative stage setups to make concerts here always just a bit more memorable than anywhere else. Pro Tip: Don't wait in that huge line going downhill outside of the venue. Head to the other line that wraps around the building instead to save your calves. Acrisure Stadium The home of the Steelers also transforms into the biggest live music venue in the city for unforgettable shows from the world's top performers on the North Shore. Taylor Swift set the record here in 2023 when her Eras Tour brought in a whopping 73,117 Swifties on night two of her stay. When you want to see the biggest acts on the planet with amazing pyrotechnics and unbelievably stage setups, it doesn't get better than Acrisure. Pro Tip: Leave the bags at home and give yourself time to get through the gates. Photo Credit: @Lenkmel on Insta PNC Park Crowds at the home of the Pirates range from 35-45k fans in attendance, with the stage usually placed in the outfield so seats can fill the infield and utilize all the normal seating for the show. You can expect to see a country concert or two plus a touring classic rock act here each summer, but the real winner here is always watching the sunset with our skyline as a backdrop. Pro Tips: As far as food goes, this is one venue I highly recommend eating at! Stick to the outfield walls for my favorite stadium bites . Don't be afraid to go to a Pirates game and test out your seat and view to the outfield and avoid any sections that might have you turned more towards the infield. Music Festivals, Breweries & More The live music continues to fill Pittsburgh on a nightly basis. I've covered as many venues as possible that lend themselves to live music, but that doesn't mean you won't find great music other places. Bars throughout the city often will have a DJ or rock act for you to enjoy, breweries will be jamming with as many live acts as they have food trucks, and oftentimes you'll find an artist just performing in Market Square for free. And remember to keep an eye on our packed list of music festivals throughout the year which celebrate our unique neighborhoods and all of the musical influences that make our city special.
