Recreation and rail trails [ edit ] Deckers Creek Trail Great Allegheny Passage Mon River Trail Montour Trail Ohio River Trail Ohio River Water Trail Panhandle Trail Stavich Bike Trail Three Rivers Heritage Trail West Penn Trail Western Maryland Rail Trail Westmoreland Heritage Trail Wheeling Heritage Trails Culture [ edit ] Pittsburgh and its surrounding area has a distinct regional identity and has historically been regarded as a transitional region within the Northeastern United States. The region's counties also fall within the borders of Appalachia as defined by the Appalachian Regional Commission . [ 29 ] The City of Pittsburgh has been characterized as the "northern urban industrial anchor of Appalachia" [ 30 ] : which makes it an anomaly compared to much of Appalachia which has traditionally been characterized as southern, rural, and economically distressed. [ 30 ] Joseph Scarpaci, professor emeritus of geography at Virginia Tech , [ 31 ] has described Pittsburgh as having "one foot in the East...and the other in the Midwest". [ 30 ] Barbara Johnstone , professor of rhetoric and linguistics at Carnegie Mellon University , ascribes this isolation and idiosyncratic cultural identity of the region to the difficulty of moving through the Allegheny Mountains and the Allegheny Plateau . The Pittsburgh area was sort of isolated. It was very hard to get back and forth across the mountains. There's always been a sense that Pittsburgh was kind of a place unto itself—not really southern, not really Midwestern, not really part of Pennsylvania. People just didn't move very much. [ 32 ] In his 2009 book, The Paris of Appalachia , Pittsburgh Post-Gazette writer Brian O'Neill meditates on this aspect of Pittsburgh's regional and cultural ambiguity. The title of the book is intentionally provocative: "The Paris of Appalachia" some have called Pittsburgh derisively, because it's still the largest city along this gorgeous mountain chain that needs a better press agent. I've long felt we should embrace that title, though few are with me. Several tried to talk me out of slapping it on the cover, but were we called "The Paris of the Rockies," we wouldn't run from it. Sometimes we're so afraid of what others think, we're afraid to say who we are. This city is not Midwestern. It's not East Coast. It's just Pittsburgh, and there's no place like it. That's both its blessing and its curse. [ 33 ] Arts [ edit ] Visual arts [ edit ] Greater Pittsburgh is home to several museums, galleries, and organizations which promote appreciation for the visual arts. The largest art museum in the region is the Carnegie Museum of Art , founded in 1895 by industrialist Andrew Carnegie and located in Pittsburgh's Oakland neighborhood.

The first professional player ( William Heffelfinger ) played for a Pittsburgh football team in 1892, which was followed by the first open professional ( John Brallier ), the first all-professional team (the Latrobe Athletic Association ), and a participant in the first all-professional league (the Pittsburgh Stars of the first National Football League ). In the case of ice hockey, the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League was the first hockey league to pay its players in 1901, eventually merging into the first fully pro league, the International Professional Hockey League , in 1904. Professional hockey in Pennsylvania predated the professionalization of the game in Canada (where it eventually came to dominate in the early 20th century) by four years. Today, the region is home to three major league franchises in baseball, football, and hockey; several minor league teams in soccer, baseball, and hockey; and three major NCAA universities.
