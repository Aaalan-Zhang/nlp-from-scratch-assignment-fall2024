[ 99 ] This is caused by frequently overflowing untreated sewage into local waterways, due to flood conditions and antiquated infrastructure. Pittsburgh has a combined sewer system, where its sewage pipes contain both stormwater and wastewater. The pipes were constructed in the early 1900s, and the sewage treatment plant was built in 1959. [ 100 ] Due to insufficient improvements over time, the city is faced with public health concerns regarding its water. [ 101 ] As little as a tenth of an inch of rain causes runoffs from the sewage system to drain into local rivers. [ 102 ] Nine billion gallons of untreated waste and stormwater flow into rivers, leading to health hazards and Clean Water Act violations. [ 103 ] The local sewage authority, Allegheny County Sanitary Authority , or ALCOSAN, is operating under Consent Decree from the EPA to come up with solutions. [ 104 ] In 2017, ALCOSAN proposed a $2 billion upgrade to the system which was approved by the EPA in 2019. [ 105 ] [ 106 ] Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA) is the city's agency required to replace pipes and charge water rates. They have come under fire from both city and state authorities due to alleged mismanagement. [ 107 ] In 2017, Mayor William Peduto advocated for a restructuring of the PWSA and a partially privatized water authority. [ 108 ] Governor Wolf subsequently assigned the PWSA to be under the oversight of the Public Utilities Commission (PUC). [ 107 ] PWSA has also been subject to criticism due to findings released in 2016 showing high levels of lead in Pittsburgh's drinking water. [ 109 ] Although Pittsburgh's drinking water had been high in lead levels, and steadily rising, for many years, many residents blame PWSA administrative changes for the spike in lead levels. [ 110 ] In the years prior, PWSA had hired Veolia, a Paris-based company, for consultation to help with mounting administrative difficulties. [ 111 ] By 2015, PWSA in consultation with Veolia had laid off 23 people, including halving the laboratory staff that was responsible for testing water safety and quality. [ 111 ] Simultaneously, PWSA in consultation with Veolia had changed what chemicals they were using to prevent metal corrosion in 2014, [ 110 ] from soda ash to caustic soda, without consulting with Department of Environmental Protection. [ 112 ] Anti-corrosive chemicals were being used because many of Pittsburgh's water pipes were made of lead, and adding anti-corrosive chemicals helped prevent lead from seeping into drinking water. [ 112 ] In 2016 lead levels were as high as 27 ppb in some cases. The legal limit is 15 ppb, although there is not a safe amount of lead in drinking water. [ 112 ] Though lead levels had been rising in previous years, they had not exceeded the legal limit. [ 110 ] In late 2015 PWSA terminated its contracted with Veolia. [ 111 ] In response to the high lead levels PWSA began adding orthophosphate to the water. [ 113 ] Orthophosphate is meant to create a coating on the inside of pipes, creating a barrier to prevent lead from leaching into drinking water. [ 113 ] PWSA has also been working to replace lead pipes, and continuing to test water for lead. [ 113 ] There remains concern among residents over the long-term effects of this lead, particularly for children, in whom lead causes permanent damage to the brain and nervous system. [ 114 ] Some people also believe that the high levels of lead reflect environmental racism, as black and Hispanic children in Pittsburgh experience elevated blood-lead levels at 4 times the rate of white children. [ 114 ] Water fountains in Langley k-8 school in Sheraden were found to have the highest levels of lead of any schools in the Pittsburgh area. These levels were about 11 times the legal limit. Some residents believe this is due to Langely being a predominantly black school, with 89% of the student body being eligible for the free lunch program.
