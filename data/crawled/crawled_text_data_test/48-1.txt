City Winery does it all, and does it all exceptionally well. The ambience, seated at modern tables in front of an elegant stage and surrounded by wine casks, is completely unique. The food menu is sprawling and delivered fresh to your table the second it is ready, so you can snack throughout the show. Oh, and the wine is great, too (I especially like their pinot noir). Plus, I never even have to leave my seat to get topped off with another glass. Pro Tip: When ordering your tickets, select the option to Have a Bottle of Wine Waiting At Your Table. It's that easy and doesn't require upfront payment. Then you can find your seats and immediately start sipping before the lights dim. Carnegie of Homestead Music Hall While many of the live music venues on this list have been old buildings reimagined into new spaces, Carnegie of Homestead is still serving its original purpose as a library, athletic facility and a grand concert hall to Homestead and surrounding neighborhoods. Seating around 1,000, at this stunning venue you'll be able to grab a drink, walk around a gorgeous library and then settle into your seats for the show in the opulent hall. I've seen everything from comedy acts to classic rock groups here, and am always pleasantly surprised at how amazing all types of music and performances sound in this 100+ year-old venue. Pro Tips: Bring a seat cushion, these seats can get a little uncomfortable. Balcony seating is lovely here, but be aware that seats on the left and right side face inwards towards the center of the venue, so you may need to watch the performance looking at an angle. The Mr. Roboto Project No frills and all about the music. Located on Penn Ave, this intimate and inclusive space has a great atmosphere, punk vibes and a simple raised stage to catch up-and-coming and local bands tear it up. One of my favorite places to check out hardcore, ska, punk, grunge and other artists you won't see in larger venues. Throw some stickers on the wall, buy some merch and keep local music thriving at Roboto . Pro Tip: Check out the art gallery space before the show or swing by on Unblurred First Fridays for amazing rotating works of local artists. Masks are required at this venue!

Collective (@dltsgdomshows) Brillobox Way back in 2005, before people had even invented the word "hipster," Brillobox established itself as the coolest bar for those wanting an elevated night out experience minus the pretension. Situated on Main. St right before Bloomfield turns in Lawrenceville, this venue promises a unique ambiance you won't find replicated anywhere else in the city and the bar menu to back up what all the hype is about. Head upstairs to their music venue for a variety of bands I am now far too old to know anything about and all seem way cooler than I'll ever be. Pro Tip: For the Millennials among us, MySpace Nite (held monthly) is the best dance party in the city. Photo Credit: @ortizonkeyz2601 on Insta Cattivo Head down the hill from Brillobox and into Lawrenceville to Cattivo , yet another alt-friendly dive venue that has been bringing live music to the city for decades. Head to their Obscure parties monthly that encourage you to let you freak flag fly as a variety of DJs play everything EDM from classic to modern genres. Their stage holds a variety of bands weekly, but especially focuses on the gothic, industrial and dark alt scenes. Pro Tip: Skip their website and Insta. Find all of their upcoming events on Facebook . Government Center Perhaps best known for their huge selection of vinyl , this record shop also manages to pack in a nice crowd with national musicians from noise rank to folk country to enjoy as you browse the wax. These owners live and breathe music, so I encourage you to explore every inch of this store and ask questions; you never know what you're going to uncover here. Pro Tip: This is secretly my favorite coffee shop in Pittsburgh. Even if you're not into music, try it out when you're in the Northside . Concerts among stacks of wax? Let's go Bottlerocket Social Hall Imagine you could transport right to a 70s bar in an iconic Pittsburgh neighborhood without needing time travel. You're in luck because Bottlerocket has all the wood paneling you'll ever need, and it's all original from the bones of the Allentown bar it was made from. What their owners have added to this time capsule of a bar is incredible live comedy, movie screenings and, most importantly for this blog, a kickin' music venue for everything alt and even vinyl release parties. Pro Tip: If you go to a seated show, you can order your beer right from a QR code and have it brought directly to your seat so you never miss a minute. Can every venue start doing this?? Tequila Cowboy Country fans, we have live music venues for you, too! Saddle up and head to Tequila Cowboy on most Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays for a rotating mix of featured country artists from the Burgh and beyond. While this place plays both types of music (country and western) wander back to the karaoke bar and sing to your heart's content at this go-to party place. Photo Credit: @briannablankenshipmusic on Insta Moondog's As old school as it gets, Moondog's has been cranking up the volume for decades in Blawnox, with fantastic acoustics supporting the best blues and rock groups in the Burgh. Pro Tip: Even if you're just stopping in for a drink, the wall of guitars behind the bar and dog-musician mural on the opposite side are worth a visit alone. This Is Red In Pittsburgh, we love churches-turned-music venues . At This is Red , St. Michael's Slovakian Roman Catholic has been resurrected into the event space and concert venue. Highlights of this venue include an intricate rose window on the outside, an exciting second life for the original Brinkerhoff piano and mural-covered Grotto which all combines into perfect ambiance for shows that include jazz, experimental, electronic and more.

The same minds behind Howlers (now closed, but this used to be the best Bloomfield bar ever) opened up this fantastic brunch/event space/live music venue/restaurant/bar . Just follow the neon sign to their monthly jazz night, live band karaoke, reggae nights and much more live music fun. 222 Ormsby After so many smaller venues went silent during the pandemic, I knew nature was healing when 222 Ormsby opened back up to live music in 2023. Prepare to two-step to Pittsburgh's best ska, punk, alt and more plus unique events like their Folk Punkapalooza in this lo-fi venue focused solely on the music. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Pittsburgh Punk Rock (@pghpunkrock) Rock Room Don't be intimidated by the graffiti and stickers covering every square inch of this Polish Hill venue , including the bathrooms. This is a fantastic punk bar that pulls in a supportive crowd and for a raucous, fun night of live music. Oh, and the food is dirt cheap and the portions are massive. What else could you need? Pro Tips: This is one of few bars where you can still smoke inside. Don't miss the pinball machines and even a chess table in the back. Poetry Lounge The stage is small, the entrance looks like a house and there's wood paneling all over the place.
