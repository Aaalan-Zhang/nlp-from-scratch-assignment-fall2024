The City’s charter mandates that only a general -purpose  financial statement be issued by May 1. This does not include component units; statements mandated  under Governmental Account Standards Board (GASB), Statement 34; footnotes; and the statistical  section. This year, we are issuing a full ACFR on April 29, 2024, which meets the Government Finance  Officers Associa tion (GFOA) standards and allows the City to get an unmodified opinion from the City’s  independent auditors.    We believe that the enclosed data is accurate in all material respects and fairly presents both the financial  position and operational results of the City’s various funds. This statement will enable the reader to gain  an understanding of the City’s financi al activities. Responsibility for both the accuracy of data and the  completeness and fairness of the presentation rests with the management of the City. This report contains  all the funds of the City.    Maher Duessel Certified Public Accountants have issued an unmodified (i.e., “clean”) opinion on the  City’s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. This independent auditor’s report is  located in front of the Management’s Discussion and A nalysis (MD&A).    The MD&A immediately follows the independent auditor’s report and provides a narrative introduction,  overview, and analysis of the basic financial statements. The MD&A complements this letter of transmittal  and should be read in conjunction with it.    I-1 414 G RANT STREET | CITY-COUNTY BUILDING , FIRST FLOOR | 412 255 2054 PROFILE OF THE GOVERNMENT     Located at the confluence of the Ohio, Monongahela, and Allegheny Rivers, the City serves as the seat  for Allegheny County and is the largest of the County’s 130 municipalities. Downtown Pittsburgh is  commonly known as the Golden Triangle and serves as the regional cente r for Southwestern Pennsylvania,  Eastern Ohio, and Northern West Virginia.    The City, incorporated in 1816, is located in the southwestern  part of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania) occupying 55.37 square miles with a  population of 302,971, according to the 2020 Census. (Note that the 2022 Census figure for the population  was 302,898.) Although ranked as the 68th most populous City in the country, the City is still considered  more densely populated than five of the top ten populous cities due to its population density of 5,469  people per square mile. This is primarily because the City limits have remained virtually unchanged for  nearly a century. (1) The City government is comprised of a strong elected mayor, a nine-member Council  elected by district, and an elected Controller. The Mayor is the chief executive of the City who appoints  the heads of various departments, and the Council has the legislative authority. (2) The Mayor is elected  to a four -year term and the Council members are elected t o staggered four -year terms in which the even - numbered districts are elected in one year and the odd -numbered districts are elected two years later. (3)  The Controller audits City government -related revenues and expenditures and conducts audits of all City departments and authorities. (4) Like the Mayor, the Controller is elected to a four -year term. The City is  empowered to levy a variety of taxes including property taxes on real estate, earned income taxes on  residents that live within the boundaries of the City, and other usage taxes charged when using certain  facilities within the City. In addition, the City levies taxes on employees that work within the City and on  businesses that operate within the City. Please see the revenue section in this letter for a more detailed  explanation of the taxes collected.    The City provides a full range of services, including police, fire, and emergency medical services;  construction and maintenance of City property and infrastructure; sanitation services; and recreation and  cultural activities. The Pittsburgh Water and Sewe r Authority (PWSA), Urban Redevelopment Authority  (URA), Stadium Authority, and Pittsburgh Parking Authority are component units of the City and are  shown as such in the financial statements and the footnotes to the ACFR.    The Council is required to adopt a final operating and capital budget for the next year by the last day of  the fiscal year, which is December 31. The annual budget is the basis of the City’s financial planning and  control. The operating budget is prepared on a departmental basis. The department heads may spend within  a budget classification (e.g., salaries, supplies, rentals, miscellaneous) as they see fit. However, any  transfers between classifications or departments have to be approved by Council. The Mayor’s Office also  prepares a five -year plan annually.     FINANCIAL INFORMATION    The Financial Information is broken down into two categories: Internal Control and Budget Control, which  are explained in further detail below.    I-2 414 G RANT STREET | CITY-COUNTY BUILDING , FIRST FLOOR | 412 255 2054 Internal Control: Management of the City is responsible for establishing and maintaining an internal  control structure designed to ensure that the assets of the City are protected from loss, theft, or misuse and  to ensure that adequate accounting informati on is compiled to prepare financial statements in accordance  with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S.). The internal control  structure is designed to provide reasonable but not absolute assurance that these object ives are met. The  concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that: (1) the cost of a control should not exceed the benefits  likely to be derived and (2) the evaluation of costs and benefits requires estimates and judgments by  management.    Budget Control: Budget control is maintained at the line -item level on a departmental basis. Activities of  the General Fund, the Special Revenue Fund (Community Development Fund only), and the Capital  Projects Fund are controlled by an annual legally appro priated budget. Capital Projects are also controlled  on a multiyear basis.    ECONOMIC BACKGROUND    In 2023, Pittsburgh continued to feel the aftereffects of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID -19)  pandemic. City finances remained buoyed by the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA), with  approximately $94.5 million fully spent in 2023 according to the City's cash basis spending reports.  Although the regional economy appears to be permanently altered by the pandemic, various hopeful  developments in workforce trends, employment, real estate, infrastructures, and technologies are present.  According to data from the University of Pittsburgh’s Center for Social and Urban Research (UCSUR),  15.8% of City residents were 65 or older in 2021, a slight rise from 2010 but lower than 20.9% for the rest  of Allegheny County and the national rate of 16. 8%.  Pittsburgh has, so far, avoided the aging workforce trends experienced in the rest of the County by  attracting a higher share of students and immigrants. Still, long-term population growth remains uncertain,  making policies that attract a younger and more diverse workforce a pressing need.  Among UCSUR’s recommendations were policies that support low-income residents, particularly the  low-income Black community. This supports the City’s 2022 Housing Needs Assessment, which found  that the City lost nearly 3,000 low-income renters, 350 Black renter households, and 700 Black households  between 2015 and 2019. In the same period, nearly every other racial and ethnic group saw gains in total  households, while the City gained 5,000 renters making over 120% of the area median income.   I-3 414 G RANT STREET | CITY-COUNTY BUILDING , FIRST FLOOR | 412 255 2054 The assessment points to increases in rents and home prices, deteriorating housing stock, and a continued  affordable housing gap as the driver of these trends —and to the City’s zoning code and land use policies  as barriers to equitable development. Combatt ing discrimination and developing equitable growth  strategies that allow the full range of income earners to live and thrive throughout the City will be key to  avoiding future population stagnation and loss.    The unemployment rate in the Pittsburgh area has drastically improved since the pandemic, dropping from  nearly 16% in April 2020 to 3.4% at the end of 2023. This matched the state’s unemployment rate and  was below the national unemployment rate of 3.5%. However, beneath the historically low unemployment  rate remains the fact that the area’s labor force continues to shrink. There are fewer people employed in  the Pittsburgh area today than there were before the pandemic, with estimates ranging from 10,000 to  40,000. The Brookings Institute reports that out of the 54 largest metro regions in the country, Pittsburgh  ranks last in overall job growth. This is largely attributed to our relatively older population and our  continued population decline.   Allegheny County’s population declined by an estimated 7,780 people between July 2022 and July 2023,  the eighth highest rate of total numeric annual decline among counties nationwide. Again, the City has  fared better than the County as a whole by attractin g a greater share of students and immigrants. In short,  job creation and economic growth in the years ahead will continue to depend heavily on our ability to  attract younger, more diverse people to our City and our region.  High interest rates slowed the sale of residential properties in Allegheny County by approximately 25%  according to the West Penn Multi -List Service. However, house prices in Pittsburgh climbed by  approximately 4% in 2023, and inventory remains competitive . On average, 2023 homes in Pittsburgh  remained on the market for the same amount of time —between 30 and 40 days —as 2022.  Challenges emerged in collecting 2023 real estate tax revenue as a result of the lowered Common Level  Ratio (CLR) in Allegheny County. The CLR dictates at what percentage of the fair market value a property  will be assessed. Pennsylvania’s Tax Equalization Board ordered that the 2023 CLR drop from 81.1% to  63.6%.   The City’s Downtown real estate market faced similar challenges to other major metropolitan areas in  responding to the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic. As workplaces embraced work -from -home or  hybrid models, Downtown office buildings became increasingly empty. According to the real estate  company Jones Lang LaSalle, vacancy rates were above 20% in December 2023. As a result, the property  values of Downtown office buildings decreased. Ten landmark buildings —U.S. Steel, PPG Place, PNC  Plaza, Three Gateway, th e Union Trust Building, PNC Firstside, Two PNC Plaza, the K&L Gates Center,  525 William Penn Place, and 11 Stanwix Street —experienced a net assessment decrease of almost $3  million in tax revenue.  I-4 414 G RANT STREET | CITY-COUNTY BUILDING , FIRST FLOOR | 412 255 2054 With that said, the word "stable" may appropriately describe the City's economy. While office spaces have  struggled, Downtown residential occupancy has remained steadily above 90%. Emerging investments in  Downtown Pittsburgh, including the passage of three Local Economic Revitalizing Tax Acts (LERTAs),  are demonstrative of the region’s commitment to retaining a healthy, thriving downtown. Also, with more  than 228 different events, booking more than 313,000 hotel rooms, our tourism industry has rebounded.   This activity contributed to $6.4 billion in economic activity in western Pennsylvania.    In 2021 and 2022, the City of Pittsburgh was awarded $335 million in pandemic response and recovery  funding. All ARPA money was deposited into a dedicated trust fund and have presented the City with the  opportunity to invest in collective objectives. The City must encumber all $335 million allocated by  December 31, 2024, and spend this money by the end of 2026. Funds must be directed toward the  following categories: COVID -19 response and the public health ramifications; premium pay for essential  workers; offsetting revenue loss caused by the pandemic; and necessary investments in water, sewer, or  broadband infrastructure. While the City’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) maintains  responsibility for federal compliance with the U.S. Department of Treasur y, the City Controller’s Office  has and will continue to audit the American Rescue Plan Trust Fund annually until its depletion along  with specific projects using money from this account. As of the end of 2023, $202,295,404 has been spent  from the ARP ATrust Fund.  In 2023, ARPA funding of $49.59 million went to the General Fund and $18.47 million to the Capital  Projects Fund. General Fund monies allowed the City to restore many vacant positions originally slated  for elimination, maintain current compensation levels to prevent layoffs, and facilitate worker retention  incentives, such as reasonable pay increases. Collectively, these funds ensured the continuation of services  provided to City residents. Capital projects funded by ARPA in 2023 included paving City streets;  upgrades to new vehicles, equipment, and Green Fleet Improvements; demolition of City-owned property;  addressing City -wide slope failures; and improving multiple senior and recreation centers throughout the  City.  With thanks to the ARPA, $9.95 million was paid to the PWSA in 2023 towards the $17 million  cooperative agreement (co -op) for Lead Service Line Replacement. At the end of 2023, there were a total  of 17 project co -op agreements with the URA equaling $65.84 million, of which $39.49 million has been  paid from the trust fund. The largest URA project is the OWNPGH Affordable Homeownership Program  for $15.625 million total, which has received $9.475 million as of the end of 2023.  Pittsburgh International Airport saw 9.2 million passengers in 2023, rebounding to 92% of pre -pandemic  levels. Driven by new routes, including service to Los Angeles, New Orleans, and Cancun, the airport  now serves more than 60 destinations. Though the Cit y has not returned to the peak airport traffic of the  1990s, whenthe airport averaged 20 million annual passengers, the growth of airport travel in 2023 is  encouraging. Additional investments in expanding Pittsburgh International Airport will likely conti nue to  increase annual passenger numbers.   I-5 414 G RANT STREET | CITY-COUNTY BUILDING , FIRST FLOOR | 412 255 2054 In regard to tech investments, the prior year was outstanding for the City. In spite of an overall fundraising  decline of nearly 30% nationally, the City experienced its second -highest year on record for investment  in the tech economy. The result was a total investment of $3.12 billion across several venture capital  investments, large corporate deals, and numerous seed and accelerator investments. This total is second  only to the $3.59 billion raised in 2021, which was a record -breaking year for funding throughout the  world.   On a national level, total deal volume for 2023 declined 29.6% from 2022’s volume. Yet, in Pittsburgh,  nearly every indicator concerning local fundraising increased. This resulted in a 203.3% increase over  2022 in total deal volume, again bucking the natio nal trend.   More than 130 Pittsburgh companies attracted investments, with an average disclosed deal value of $27.1  million, a 300% year-over-year increase. This was largely driven by activity in the robotics and  autonomous vehicle arenas, resulting in Pittsburgh land ing among the top 10 metro areas in terms of the  number of deals per capita generated in AI.   Corporate investments increased nearly 800%, due primarily to private investments in both Stack AV and  Aurora in particular. Even when excluding the larger deals, Pittsburgh’s tech economy had a markedly  robust performance, with the average deal size acros s venture capital, seed, angel, and accelerator  investments increasing by 50%, from $4.6 million in 2022 to $6.9 million in 2023.  The Pittsburgh region saw approximately $621.5 million invested by institutional investors, $2.2 billion  invested by corporations, and $89.0 million in angel, pre-seed or seed funding. Some of the top deals in  2023 included Optimus Technologies, LyGenesis, Agile Space Industries, Formlogic, and BlastPoint. As  noted above, the highest volume of investment was in the autonomous vehicle industry, with Stack AV’s  billion -dollar funding and Aurora’s combined private placement and second public offering. These  successes are further encouragement to the local artific ial intelligence (AI) and robotics community.  An emerging trend of increased investments for Hardware and Robotics clearly continues, as those sectors  comprised 68% of total investments in 2023, compared to 39% in 2022, due largely to private investments  in Stack AV and Aurora. Even so, the number of unique companies funded across main industries confirms  that the City maintained relatively even activity across deals in software, hardware, and life sciences,  thereby maintaining diverse options for potential investors.    I-6 414 G RANT STREET | CITY-COUNTY BUILDING , FIRST FLOOR | 412 255 2054 Exits typically occur in the form of an outright purchase, merger, or acquisition of a start-up by a larger  company. Each successful exit strengthens the regional tech ecosystem by providing capital back to  venture capitalists, business angels and overall investors as a return on their original investment. With  each exit, investors realize a positive return and are more likely to invest in the region again. Other  investors learn of these successes and thereby consider Pittsburgh as a more attractive destina tion. In  addition, the founders and employees receive windfall gains and may become angel investors or mentors,  along with being financially well-positioned to pursue new ventures themselves. The volume of exits,  along with the start-ups, serves as a metri c for the growth and vitality of the local investment environment.  Thus, increased deal activity creates an ongoing cycle within the entrepreneurial community.  Last year featured 12 exits with disclosed values of over $1.57 billion. All were acquisitions, apart from  Aurora and Coeptis Therapeutics, each of which had deals that included both a private placement of capital  and a secondary public offering. Represent ative deals included: Avere Systems, acquired by Microsoft;  Babel Health, acquired by Allscripts; Cancer Treatment Services International, acquired by Varian  Medical Systems; Centria, acquired by NuCor; M*Modal, acquired by 3M; Aurora, a merger; and  Duolin go, an Initial Public Offering (IPO).  The City is consistently attracting investors from around the world, with 57 new investors making their  first investment in the region in 2023. Over 300 unique venture capital firms, angel groups and strategic  investors have invested in Pittsburgh companie s in the past five years . When global firms acquire local startups via exits, it often catalyzes larger firms establishing permanent  offices in Pittsburgh. Examples of larger tech firms with a significant local presence as a result of startup  acquisitions include Bosch, Facebook, A ptiv, Facebook, Microsoft, Philips, Proofpoint, and others.   Pittsburgh continues to successfully compete with high-population centers, particularly with its strength  in AI. In 2023, the Pittsburgh region ranked 24th in population, but ranked 15th in dollars invested and  21st in total number of deals per million res idents. Focusing on the AI and autonomous vehicle industries  specifically, Pittsburgh ranked 10th in the number of deals and 16th in total dollars invested.  Over the  past decade, Pittsburgh ranked 13th in the number of deals and 10th in dollars invested per million  residents in the AI and autonomous vehicle sectors. If population changes over the past decade were  accounted for, those rankings would be even higher.  2023 also ranked as another record year for non-dilutive funding (i.e. grants), which fund innovative  research without diluting the investor. Local research universities have attracted over $12 billion in  research funding over the past decade, with $1.67 billion in 2023 alone. The University of Pittsburgh is  among the top recipients of National Institutes of Health funding, achieving a research budget surpassing  $1 billion again in 2023. Carnegie Mellon’s research budget totaled $494 million across the Software  Engineering Institute in addition to the Advanced Robotics Manufacturing Institute. Collectively, the  City’s non -dilutive budgets have grown steadily, up 71% over the past decade.  I-7 414 G RANT STREET | CITY-COUNTY BUILDING , FIRST FLOOR | 412 255 2054 Accolades from major players about the investment potential of Pittsburgh’s tech environment echo the  confidence that investors feel. A sampling of testimonials from current investors and entrepreneurs  includes:  “We are delighted to be lead investors in Noveome Biotherapeutics which is advancing a novel  secretome -based therapeutic. This ground -breaking therapy was developed and will be  manufactured in Pittsburgh. We believe that Pittsburgh’s scientific community, with ties to world  class medical institutions, will be integral to the company’s success.”    Michael Kaufman                                                                                                                          CEO of MAK Capital  “Investing in AI startups in Pittsburgh, especially those nurtured by the dynamic ecosystem around  Carnegie Mellon, is a strategy that eLab Ventures strongly believes in. The combination of  exceptional talent, pioneering research, and a thriving entrepreneurial spirit in this area offers a  fertile ground for groundbreaking AI innovations. Our investment in BlastPoint stands as a prime  example of this e cosystem’s potential. BlastPoint, with its cutting -edge AI solutions, exemplifies  the type of transformative startups that emerge from this environment. At eLab Ventures, we’re  committed to supporting these ventures, recognizing that our investments go beyond financial  gains —they’re an investment in a technologically advanced and better future, powered by the  deep -tech entrepreneurial ecosystem of Pittsburg h.”  Doug Neal                                                                                                                                             Managing Director of eLab Ventures  “Optimus Technologies is decarbonizing the heavy -duty diesel engine and we are proud to be  building our team in Pittsburgh. Since our Series A closed in early 2023, we have been lucky to  increase more than 2.5x our headcount and are growing even more in 20 24. The passion and work  ethic of Steel City is keeping our company and the tech ecosystem stronger than ever.”  Lori Dunn                                                                                                                                                 COO of Optimus Technologies  “Pittsburgh is an unmatched tech hub, as well as being home for most of our employees. Manu of  us at Edge have been fortunate enough to work with world -renowned tech gurus and experts in  their respective fields. As a company, we are ecstatic to continue bringing game -changing  technology to the world.”  Brandon Ingram                                                                                                                             CEO of Edge AI Solutions  I-8 414 G RANT STREET | CITY-COUNTY BUILDING , FIRST FLOOR | 412 255 2054 “I came to Pittsburgh as a Carnegie Mellon computer science graduate student, and now I can’t  imagine starting a company anywhere else. Not only do we have so many smart, talented people,  but the startup technology sector operates as a community, making resources accessible, like  capital, advising, and most importantly, customers.”  Alison Alverez                                                                                                                                Founder and CEO of BlastPoint  In September of 2023, the Pittsburgh Promise announced that the class of 2028 would be the last class to  receive privately funded scholarships through the organization. Since its inception, the Pittsburgh Promise  has provided $171.5 million scholarships toapproximately 11,600 Pittsburgh Public School Students.  Pittsburgh Public Schools noted that the Promise has helped improve graduation rates. However, the  district also pointed to additional student services that will continue to support academic achievem ent.   Enrollment at Pittsburgh Public Schools continued to decrease, from 20,080 students during the 2021 - 2022 school year to 19,616 students during the 2022 -2023 school year. According to a report by A+  schools, 5,250 students within the school district were enrolled in charter schools during this academic  period. Student enrollment in charter schools constitutes a significant burden to the school district’s  finances, approaching a cost of $140 million.  The present outlook for the City remains stable through the end of 2024. Outstanding debt obligations due  in 2025 and 2026, coupled with the expiration of ARPA funds at the end of 2024, are likely to present  challenges. The City should focus on proactively responding to these pending financial difficulties during  the 2024 fiscal year. Efforts such as diversifying our investments, supporting local business development,  and coordinating with other taxing bodies have already shown demonstrable benefit. These e fforts should  continue alongside conversations with local businesses, municipal partners, and non-profits to ensure a  coordinated investment in our long -term financial future.  2023 CONTROLLER AUDITS  The Controller’s office for the City of Pittsburgh released the following audits in 2023.

The Certificate of Achievement is a prestigious  national award recognizing conformance with the highes t standards for preparation of state and local  government financial reports.    In order to be awarded a Certificate of Achievement, a government unit must publish an easily readable  and efficiently organized ACFR that conforms to program standards. Such an ACFR must satisfy both  generally accepted accounting principles and applicable legal requirements.    A Certificate of Achievement is valid for a period of one year only. The City has received a Certificate of  Achievement for the last thirty -one consecutive years (fiscal years ended 1992 –2022). We believe that  our current ACFR continues to conform to the Certificate of Achievement program requirements, and we  are submitting it to the GFOA to determine its eligibility for another certificate.    ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS    The preparation of this report could not be possible without the concerted effort of the entire staff of the  Controller's Office. The continued efforts of the Accounting Department are gratefully appreciated. I  would like to thank the employees of the various departments and Authorities of the City for their  assistance in providing the Controller's staff and the independent auditors with the necessary information  to complete this report.    Respectfully submitted,    Rachael Heisler City Controller City of Pittsburgh I-11  Government  Finance  Officers  Association Certificate of   Achievement for Excellence in Financial  Reporting Presented  to City of Pittsburgh Pennsylvania For its  Annual  Comprehensive Financial Report For the Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2022 Executive Director/CEO I-13 I-14CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA ELECTED CITY OFFICIALS As of April 2 9, 202 4 MAYOR Ed Gainey CONTROLLER Rachael Heisler MEMBERS OF COUNCIL R.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the  respective financial position of the governmental activities, the aggregate discretely presented  component units, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of the City,as of  December 31,2023, and the respective changes in financial position and, the respective budgetary  comparison for the General Fund and Community Development Fund for the year then ended in  accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion s We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United  States of America. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s  Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to  be independent of the City and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the  relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have  obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion s. Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation ofthefinancial statements in  accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for  the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair  presentation offinancial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud  or error. In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are  conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the City's ability  The Honorable Members of Council City of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Independent Auditor’s Report iito continue as a going concern for twelve months beyond the financial statement date, including any  currently known information that may raise substantial doubt shortly thereafter . Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether thefinancial statements as a whole  are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report  that includes our opinion s. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute  assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally  accepted auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not  detecting a ma terial misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as  fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of  internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there isa substantial likelihood that,  individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based  on the financial statements. In performing an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards , we: Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of thefinancial statements, whether  due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks.  Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and  disclosures in the financial statements. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit  procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing  an opinion on the effectiveness of theCity's internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is  expressed. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of  significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall   presentation of the financial statements. Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the  aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about theCity's ability to continue as a going concern  for a reasonable period of time. We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other  matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal  control related matters that we identified during the audit. The Honorable Members of Council City of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Independent Auditor’s Report iiiRequired Supplementary Information Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the required  supplementa ryinformation listed in the table of contents be presented tosupplement the basic  financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and, although not a part  of the basic financial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board, who  considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in  an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited  procedures to the required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards  generally accepted in the United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of management  about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the information for consistency with  management’s responses to our inquiries, thebasic financial statements, and other knowledge we  obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express an opinion or provide  any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient  evidence to express an opi nion or provide any assurance. Supplementary Information Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinion son the financial statements that  collectively comprise the City’s basic financial statements . The supplementary information listed in  the table of contents is presented for purposes of additional analysis and is not a required part of the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived  from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare thebasic financial statements. The information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the  audit of thebasic financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and  reconciling s uch information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare  the basic financial statements or to the basic financial statements themselves, and other additional  procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America.  In our opinion, the supplementary information is fairly stated ,in all material respects ,in relation to  the basic financial statements as a whole. Other Information Management is responsible for the introductory section, statisti cal section and other section  (collectively “other information ”)listed in the table of contents . The other information listed in the  table of contents does not include the basic financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.  Our opinions on the basic financial statements do not cover the other information, and we do not  express an opinion or any form of assurance thereon. In connection with our audit of the basic financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other  information and consider whether a material inconsistency exists between the other information and  the basic financial statements, or the other information otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  The Honorable Members of Council City of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Independent Auditor’s Report ivIf, based on the work performed, we conclude that an uncorrected material misstatement of the  other information exists, we are required to describe it in our report. Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania April 2 9, 202 4 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS vManagement’s Discussion and Analysis As management of the City of Pittsburgh (City), we offer the readers of the City’s financial  statements this narrative overview and analysis of the financial activities of the City for the fiscal  year ended December 31, 2023. We encourage readers to consider the information presented here  in conjunction with additional information that we have furnished in our letter of transmittal, which  can be found a t the beginning of this report. Financial Highlights Government -wide unrestricted net position showed a deficit of $1.27 billion in 2023.The  accumulated deficit results principally from the City’s Net Pension Liability of $817.0 million,  Other Poste mployment benefits liabilit iesof $315.1million , outstanding general obligation bonds  being issued over the years to finance projects that do not result in recording assets; specifically , to fund the payments to the Pension Trust Fund ($27.9 million outstanding as of December 31, 2023), the City’s borrowings to finance economic development efforts (including projects to the  City’s Authorities, principally the URA), and maintenance expenditures on C ity infrastructure and  equipment needs. The deficiency will have to be funded from resources generated in future years. As of the close of the 2023fiscal year, the City’s governmental funds reported combined  ending fund balances of $470.5million , an increase of$56.2million from the previous  year. Approximately 42.2%of this total amount or $198.7million is available for spending  at the gov ernment’s discretion (unassigned fund balance). At the end of the2023fiscal year, unassigned fund balance for the General Fund was  $198.7 million (compared to $167.2 million in2022) or29.6% of total General Fund  expenditures and debt service transfers for 2023, upfrom 27.4% in 20 22. The City’s outstanding general obligation bonds and notes including unamortized  premium/discount amounted to $502million at the end of the fiscal year upfrom $488 million in 2022. Overview of the Financial Statements This Management’s Discussion and Analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the City’s  basic financial statements. The financial section of this report consists of three parts: Management’s Discussion and Analysis,  the basic financial statements (including notes to the financial statements and detailed budgetary  comparison schedules), and combining and individual fund statements.  The basic financial  statements present two different views of the City through the use of government -wide statements  and fund financial statements: The first two statements (pages 1 -3) are government -wide financial statements that provide short - term and long -term information about the City’s overall financial status. viThe remaining statements (pages 4 through 20) are fund financial statements that focus on  individual parts of City government and report operations in more detail than the government -wide  financial statements.   The governmental funds statements describe how general government services were financed such  as public safety and sanitation. Fiduciary fund statements provide information about pension, other post-employment benefit  plans, private -purpose trust funds, and custodial funds for which the City acts solely as a trustee  or agent for the benefit of others.  Fiduciary funds are not reflected in the government -wide  financial statements because the resources cannot be used to support City activities.  The financial statements include notes which provide an explanation for certain financial statement  line items and also provide more details for this information.  The statements are followed by a  section of required supplementary information that further explains and supports the information  in the financial statements.  In addition to these required elements, a section with combining  statements provides details about the non-major governmental funds that are presented in single  columns in the basic financ ial statements.  The following diagram, labeled A-1, shows how the  required components of this comprehensive annual financial report are arranged and relate to one  another.

The government -wide  financial statements include not only the City itself (known as the primary government), but also  legally separate Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority,  Public Parking Authori ty, and the Stadium Authority. Financial informat ion for these component  units reported separately from the financial information are presente d for the primary government  itself. Thegovernment -wide statements can be found in the financial section of this report . Although there are a number ofgovernment -wide financial statements, for the purposes of this  report, only two will be highlighted since they are closely related: the statement of net position and  the statement of activities. The statement of net position includes all of the City’s assets, liabilities, deferred inflows, and  outflows, except fiduciary funds.  Net position -the difference between the City’s assets and  deferred outflows of resources and liabilities and deferred inflows of resources -is one way to  measure the City’s financial health, or position.  Over time, increases or decreases in the City’s  net position serve as a useful indicator of whether thefinancial position of the City is improving  or deteriorating.   viii       Measurement Focus: Economic Resources Accounting Basis: AccrualThe statement of activities presents information showing how the government’s net position  changed during the most recent fiscal year.  All changes in net position are reported as soon as the  underlying event gives rise to the change that occurs, regardles s of the timing of related cash flows.   Thus, revenues and expenses are reported in this statement for some items that will only result in  cash flows in future fiscal periods (e.g., uncollected taxes and earned but unused vacation leave).   Additional non-financial factors such as changes in the City’s real property tax base and general  economic conditions must be considered to assess the overall position of the City.   The primary features of government -wide financial statements are reflected in Figure A -3. Figure A -3 Government -wide Financial Statements •Governmental activities -Most of the City’s basic services are included here, such as the  police, public works, recreation , and general administration. Property and earned income  taxes, charges for services, and federal and state grants finance most of these activities. Fund Financial Statements The fund financial statements provide more detailed information about the City’s most significant  funds, not the City as a whole. A fund is a group of related accounts that are used to maintain  control over resources that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives.     Funds are  used to keep track of specific sources of funding and spending for particular purposes.  The City,  like other state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance  with finance -relate d legal requirements. However, not all funds are the result of city policy; some  are required by state law.  The funds of the City can be divided into two categories, governmental  funds and fiduciary funds, and are explained in greater detail below:  •Governmental Funds -Most of the City’s basic services are included in governmental funds,  which focus on (1) how cash and other financial assets can readily be converted to cash flow  in and out and (2) the balances left at year-end that are available for spending.  Consequent ly,  the governmental funds statements provide a detailed short -term view that helps you  determine whether there are more or fewer financial resources that can be spent in the near  future to finance the City’s programs. Governmental funds are used to account for essentially  the same functions reported as governmental activities in the governm ent-wide financial  statements. The relationship between governmental activities (reported in the statement of Governmental Activities  Statement of Net Position            Assets + Deferred Outflows -  Liabilities –Deferred Inflows           = Net PositionStatement of Activities      Net Program (Expense) Revenue        + General Revenues      = Change in Net Position ixnet position and the statement of activities) and governmental funds is described in a  reconciliation that follows the governmental fund financial statements .  However, unlike the  government -wide financial statements, governmental fund financial statements focus on  near-term inflows and outflows of expendable resources, as well as on balances of  expendable resources available at the end of the fiscal year. Such information may be useful  in evaluating a government’s near -term financing requirements. Because the focus of government funds is narrower than that of the government -wide  financial statements, it is useful to compare the information presented for governmental  funds with similar information presented for governmental activities. By doing so, readers  may better understand the long-term impact of the government’s near-term financing  decisions. Both the governmental fund balance sheet and the governmental fund statement  of reve nues, expenditures, and changes in fund balance provide a reconciliat ion to facilitate  this comparison between governmental funds and governmental activities.  The City maintains individual government alfunds. Information is presented separately in the  governmental fund balance sheet and in the governmental fund statement of revenues,  expenditur es, and changes in fund balance for the General Fund, the Capital Projects Fund ,  the Community Development Fund, the American Rescue Plan Act Fund, and the Debt  Service Fund, all of which are considered to be major funds. Data from the other six  governmental funds (non-major funds) are combined into a single, aggregated presentation  (other governmental funds). The City adopts an annual appropriated budget for its General Fund , Capital Projects Fund,  and Community Development Fund. A budgetary comparison statement has been provided  for these funds to demonstrate compliance with these budgets. The basic governmental fund financial statements can be found on pages 4-15of this report. Fiduciary Funds -(Pension Trust Funds , OPEB Trust Fund s,Private -Purpose Trust  Funds and Custodial Funds ) –The Pension Trust Fund accounts for the operations of the  City’s pension plans for general municipal employees, police, and fire, covering  essentially all full -time employees.  The OPEB Trust Fund s are used to report resources  held in trust for post-employment benefits other than pension benefits.  The City is  responsible for ensuring that the assets reported in fiduciary funds are used for their  intended purposes.  All of the City’s fiduciary activitie s are reported in a separate  statement of fiduciary net position and a statement of changes in fiduciary net position.   We exclude these activities from the City’s government -wide financial statements  because the City cannot use these assets to finance its operations. The fiduciary fund financial statements can be found on pages 16-17ofthis report. Notes to financial statements -The notes provide additional information that is essential to a full  understanding of the data provided in the government -wide and fund financial statements. The  notes to the financial statements can be found on pages 21 -139of this report. Required supplementary information -In addition to the basic financial statements and  accompanying notes, this report also presents certain required supplementary information  xconcerning the City’s progress in funding its obligation to provide pension benefits to its  employees. Required supplementary information can be found on pages 140-149of this repor t. Government -wide Financial Analysis TheCity’sliabilities and deferred inflows of resources exceeded assets and deferred outflows of  resources by $1.10billion at the close of the most recent fiscal year. Net Pension and Other  Postemployment benefits liabilities totaled $1.13billion. By far the largest portion of the City’s  deficit in net position is its unrestricted deficit of $1.27billion . This deficit is partially offset by  investment in capital assets less any related debt still outstanding used to acquire those assets of  $158.7million .The City uses these capital assets to provide services to citizens; consequently,  these assets are not available for future spending and the assets have been financed with debt in an  amount that exceeds the capital assets carrying value.

Such information is useful in  assessing the City’s financing requirements. In particular, unassigned fund balance may serve as  a useful measure of a government’s net resources available for spending at the end of the fiscal  year. The General Fund is the chief operating fund of the City, with revenues and expenses that are  connected to every aspect of the City. Revenues for the General Fund totaled $646.9million in  2023. Economic conditions stemming from the pandemic continued to impact revenue to budget  fluctuations , although not as severely as 2021or 2022 .  The largest variances were deed transfer  tax revenues, which fell short of budget by $21.1 million as home sales fell in response to rising  interest rates. Also impacted negatively were real estate tax revenues with a negative variance of  $10.3 million . These losses were offset in partbyapayroll prep tax of$71.9 million ,which was  $6.6 million over budget ,astronger than expected earned income tax of $131. 7million, $4.7 million over budget ,andhigher interest on investments resulting in interest revenue $11.6million  over budget . In addition to the above General Fund tax revenues, the City earned $19.3million in the  Community Development Fund, $27.4million in Capital Projects, and $65.4 million in Non-major Governmental Funds ,mostly from pass-through of federal and state monies .  The City also  recognized $75.2 million American Rescue Plan Act Fund money as revenue , in addition to $ 16.9 million in the Capital Projects Fund, for aiding recovery from theeconomic and health effects of  the COVID -19 pandemic .  The City created and adopted a four-year plan for utilizing the recovery  funds in accordance with all regulatory and statut ory requirements .   At the end of the current fiscal year,the City’s governmental funds reported combined ending fund  balances of $ 470.4million, anincrease of $ 56.2 million from 20 22. Approximately 42.2% of this  total fund balance, or $198.7 million ,constitutes unassigned fund balance, which is available for  spending at the government’s discretion. The remainder of the fund balance that is restricted for  endowments, employ ee benefits, State and Federal Purpose G rants, and capital projects is$106.9 million, the amount committed to interfund advance and specific programs is $35.2million and  the amount assigned for encumbrances and debt service is $ 129.6million .  At the end of the current fiscal year, the unassigned fund balance of the General Fund was $ 198.7 million, while total fund balance for the General Fund was $241.3million.  As a measure of the  General Fund’s liquidity, it may be useful to compare both unassigned fund balance and total fund  balance to total fund expenditures. Unassigned fund balance represents 29.6%of total General  Fund expen ditures and operating transfers. The fund balance of the City’s General Fund increased by $38.3 million during the 2023fiscal  year compared to anincrease of $73.0million in2022.This drop in the amount of the positive  change in fund balance is primarily due to revenues staying flat while expenditures increased. Expenditures and other uses, including d ebt service payments/transfers from the General Fund in  2023increased to $672.0 million, compared to $627.8 million in 2022representing aincrease of 7.0% or $ 44.2million overall.  xvTransfers to the Debt Service Fund of $59.4 million ,combined with debt subsidies of $3.2million , totaled $62.6 million ,compared to $62.8 million in 2022.  The debt subsidies for the URA are  commitments made by the City over the life of theirbonds .Debt service and debt subsidies  accounted for 9.8% of the total governmental expenditures ,illustrating the magnitude of the City’s  annual debt service . The Debt Service Fund has a total fund balance of $ 4.1million , all of which  is assigned for the payment of debt service.   The Community Development Fund had intergovernmental revenues of $19.3million and  expenditures of $19.3million.  The Capital Projects Fund had $27.4 million of revenues , and $88.9 million in maintenance and non-capital related expenses ,$63.6million in new capital debt  proceeds and $19.4million in net operating transfe rs.  The Capital Projects Fund sfund balance  increased by $21.7 million to $173.6 million in 2023as compared to $151.9 million as of  December 31, 2022due to the issuance of a new bond and an increase in transfers from other  funds. General Fund Budgetary Highlights Actual General Fund revenues were lessthan the budgeted revenues by $9.5million mainly due  toadecrease of revenue in deed transfer and real estate taxes offset by higher interest earnings . The f inal budgeted Gen eral Fund expenditures were $ 33.0 million higher than the original budget.   Actual General Fund budget ary basis expenditures were $34.1million lower than the final budget . During fiscal year 2023, City Council amended the budget primarily for the following reason: To appropriate funds to pay prior year commitments in the form of encumbrances for General  Fund purchase orders authorized and issued, but for which goods and services were not  received n or paid for by December 31, 20 23totaled $ 33.0 million.  To increase Earned Income Tax revenue based on an increase in prior year actuals.  xviCapital Asset and Debt Administration Capital assets -The City’s investment in capital assets for its governmental -type activities as of  December 31, 20 23amounts to $ 238.0million ,net of accumulated depreciation.

Significant Events Early in 2018 ,a resolution by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania was adopted to allow theCity to  formally exit Act 47 oversight, thereby ending its designation asa “financially distressed  municipality.” During 2023,the City continued efforts to control costs, maximize collections, and  maintain solvency.  The cash balance available for general operations of the City as of December 31,  2023was $ 203.0million; this was enough to maintain normal function throughout the City in January  2024.As of December 31, 2023, the City had a General Fund unassign ed fund balance of $198.7 million. The City will continue to focus on strategies to fund long-term obligations, principally net  pensi onobligations, net other post -employment obligations, general obligation debt and reduce its net  deficit of $1.1billion in 2024. The City recognizes that the budgetary impact of the COVID -19  pandemic continues tobe significant but remains optimistic that steps can be taken to manage city  finances going forward. Pension Funding Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Act 47 of 2009 required the City’s aggregate pension funding  level to be at least 50 percent by December 31, 2010 to avoid having the City’s pension funds  seized and administered by the Pennsylvania Municipal Retirement System.  TheCity met this  requirement by transferring $45 million to the Comprehensive Trust Fund (Fund )in 2010 and  agreeing to dedicate parking tax revenues for the next 31 years per Council legislation .  During  2021, Council legislation extended parking taxpayments dedicated to pension funding to 2046.    xviiiThe City contributed $13.4 million of the parking tax revenue to the Fund from 2011 -2017 and  contribute d$26.8 million from 2018 through 2022.  The City will continue to contribute $26.8  million per year from 2023through 2046.For 2023, the City contributed $106.1million , $49.6 million more than its actuarially determined contribution of $ 56.5million .

However, inthestatement ofactivities, the cost ofthose assets isallocated over their estimated useful lives as depreciation expense. This isthe amount bywhich capital outlays and net deletions exceeded depreciation/amortization in the current period: Some levied taxes and other revenues willnotbecollected forseveral months after the City's year-end, they are not considered as"available" revenues inthe governmental funds.  Deferred inflows changed by this amount during the year. Changes inthe net OPEB liabilities and related deferred inflows and outflows of resources donotaffect current financial resources and, therefore, arenot reflected on the fund statements. The issuance oflong-term obligations (e.g., notes, bonds and leases) provides current financial resources togovernmental funds, while therepayment oftheprincipal oflong- term obligations consumes the current financial resources ofgovernmental funds. Neither transaction, however, has any effect onthe statement ofactivities. Also, governmental funds report theeffect ofpremiums, discounts, interest, and similar items when debt isfirst issued, whereas these amounts are deferred and amortized inthe statement ofactivities. This amount isthe net effect ofthese differences inthe treatment of long-term obligations and related items. Inthestatement ofactivities, certain expenses -workers' compensation, compensated absences, and claims and judgments aremeasured bytheamounts incurred during the year. Inthegovernmental funds, however, expenditures forthese items aremeasured bythe amount offinancial resources used. This amount represents the difference between the amount incurred versus the amount used.Changes inthe net pension liability and related deferred inflows and outflows of resources donotaffect current financial resources and, therefore, arenot reflected on the fund statements.Long-term receivables, including loan receivable due from component unit, arenotdue inthecurrent period and, therefore, arenotreported asreceivable inthefunds. Long- term receivables changed by this amount during the year.

The City operates under a  strong mayor form of government and provides the following services as authorized by its  charter : public safety (police, fire, and emergency medical services), highways and streets,  sanitation , economic development, cultural and recreational, public improvements, planning and  zoning, and general administrative services.  The major accounting principles and practices followed by the City are presented below to assist  the reader in evaluating the financial statements and the accom panying notes.  (A)The Financial Reporting Entity The criteria used by the City to evaluate the possible inclusion of related entities (Authorities,  Boards, Councils, etc.) outside of the legal City entity within its reporting entity are financial  accountability and the nature and significance of the relationship. In determining financial  accountability in a given case, the City review s the applicability of the following criteria:  The City is financially accountable for: 1.Legally separate organizations if City officials appoint a voting majority of the  organization’s governing body and the City is able to impose its will on the organization  or if there is a potential for the organization to provide specific financial benefits to, or  impose specific financial burdens on, the primary government. a.Impose its Will –If the City can significantly influence the program s, projects, or activities  of, or the level of services performed or provided by, the organization.  b.Financial Benefit or Burden –Exists if the City (1) is entitled to the organization’s  resources, (2) is legally obligated or has otherwise assumed the obligation to finance the  deficits of, or provide support to, the organization, or (3) is obligated in some manner for  the debt of the organization. CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 222.Legally separate organizations that are fiscally dependent on the City and a financial  benefit or burden relationship are present. Fiscal dependency is established if the  organization is unable to adopt its budget, levy taxes or set rates or charges or issue  bonded debt without approval by the City. Based on the foregoing criteria, the reporting entity has been defined to include all the legally separate -government entities for which the City is financially accountable or for which there is a  significant relationship (component units). Specific information on the nature of the various  potential component units and a description of how the aforementioned criteria have been  considered in determining whether or not to include or exclude such organizations in the City’s  financial statements are provided inthe following paragraphs. Audited financial statements for  all of the component units are available for public inspection in the City Controller’s office.  (B)Net Position Deficit and Liquidity As of December 31, 202 3, the City had a general fund unassigned fund balance of $198.8 million  and a general fund cash balance of $ 203.0 million. The City will continue to focus on strategies to  fund long -term obligations, principally net pension obligations, net other post -employment  obligations, general obligation debt and reduce its net position deficit of $1.10billion at  December 31, 202 3. (C)Individual Component Unit Disclosures Blended Component Units Some component units, despite being legally separate from the City government, are so  intertwined with the City government, whether through sharing common governing boards with  the City or through providing services solely to the City that they are, in substance, the same as  the City government and are reported as part of the City government. The blended component  units reported in th isway are the following: City of Pittsburgh Equipment Leasing Authority City Pension Trust City of Pittsburgh Equipment Leasing Authority (ELA) The ELA was incorporated in 1980 to serve as a financing vehicle for the acquisition of equipment.  The Board consists of the City’s Chief Operating and Administrative Officer, the Finance and Law  Chair of Pittsburgh City Council, an additional member of Pittsburgh City Council , the City’s  CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 23Director of the Department of Public Safety, and the City’s Director of the Department of Public  Works.  Although it is legally separate from the City, the ELA is reported as if it were part of the City  government, because its sole purpose is to finance the City equi pment needs. Its operations are  included within other government funds. It operates on a December 31 fiscal year. City Pension Trust As described in Note 7, the City has a comprehensive pension trust for financial reporting  purposes that is comprised of three defined benefit pension plans: the Municipal Pension Plan  (Municipal), the Policemen’s Relief and Pension Plan (Police) ;and the Firemen’s Relief and  Pension Plan (Fire) ;which together cover substantially all City employees. As required by  Pennsylvania Law, a comprehensive Board oversees funding and investing activities. This Board  consists of seven members, four of whom are appointed by the Mayor.  Plan benefit matters are administered by separate boards which include, for all plans, the  president of the City Council and the City Controller and additi onally, in the case of the Municipal   and Fire plans, the Mayor. The pension plans operate on a fiscal year ending December 31. Their operations are included in  the Pension Trust Fund, as a fiduciary fund.  Disc retely Presented Component Units Discretely presented component units are entities that are legally separate from the primary  government but the omission of which would cause the primary government’s financial  statements to be misleading or incomplete. As these component units do not meet the criteria  for blended presentation, they are reported separately from the primary government. The  component units presented in this manner are the following: Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority Stadium Authority of the City of Pittsburgh Public Parking Authority of Pittsburgh Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 24Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA) PWSA was incorporated in February 1984 under the Municipality Authorities Act of 1945 to  assume responsibility for the operation and improvement of the City’s water distribution and  wastewater collection system s.

The L ease and Management Agreement provided for the  City to operate and maintain the System for PWSA subject to the general supervision of PWSA. The City and PWSA agreed to terminate the 1984 Lease and Management Agreement in July 1995  and concurrently entered into a Cooperation Agreement and a Capital Lease Agreement  (collectively referred to as the Agreement s). The effect of these Agreements was to substantially  transfer financial and management responsibility for the System to PWSA.

Prior to April 1, 2018, the PWSA had the right to establish user fees and charge swithout being  subject to the approval of any department, board, or agency of Pennsylvania or the City. Effective  April 1, 2018 ,the Public Utility Commission (PUC) began oversight of PWSA . PUC oversight  requires compliance and conformity with their established regulations regarding administration,  finances, operations, reporting, capital expen ditures, and customer service for water and  wastewater utilities. The PUC now approves all PWSA rates and fees through tariff filings.

The gove rnment -wide statements segregate governmental  activities, which are normally supported by taxes and intergovernmental revenues, and business - type activities, if any, which rely on user fees and charges for support. Component units, which  are legally separa teand discretely presented, are also segregated.  Statement of Net Position –presents both governmental and business -type activities, if any, on  the full accrual, economic resource basis, which incorporates long -term assets and receivables,   deferred outflows of resources ; long -term debt and obligations; and deferred inflows of  resources. Statement of Activities –presents the net cost of each individual function. Program reve nues are  presented as a reduction of the total cost of providing program services. Program revenues  include charges for servi ces, operating grants and contributions and capital grants that are  directly associated with a specific function. Taxes and other revenue sources not reported as  program revenue are included as general revenue.  Fund Financial Statements –The City’s accounts are organized on the basis of funds, each of  which is considered to be a separate accounting entity. The operation of each fund is accounted  for by providing a separate set of self-balancing accounts that comprise its assets, liabili ties,  deferred inflows of resources, fund balances or net position, revenues, and expenditures or  expenses, as appropriate.  Government resources are allocated to and accounted for in individual funds based upon the  purposes for which they are to be spent and the means by which spending activities are  controlled.

It finances the regular  day-to-day operations of the City. It is used to account for all financial revenues and expenditures,  except those required to be accounted for in another fund.  Debt Service Fund –The Debt Service Fund is used to account for the accumulation of resources  for, and the payment of, long -term debt principal, interest, and related costs.  CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 30Special Revenue Community Development Block Grant Fund –Community Development Block  Grant Fund is used to account for the cost of neighborhood development and improvement  projects. These programs are financed primarily by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban  Development (HUD) under the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program . A  substantive portion of the funds received under the program have been allocated to the Urban  Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh.  Capital Projects Fund –A Capital Projects Fund is used to account for financial resources to be  used for the acquisition or construction of major capital facilities.  Special Revenue American Rescue Plan Act Fund –American Rescue Plan Act Fund is used to  account for financial resources to be used for expenditures allowable under the American Rescue  Plan Act.  Nonmajor Governmental Funds –These funds include all other non -major governmental funds. Fiduciary Funds account for assets held by the City in a trustee capacity or as an agent for  individuals and other governmental units. The fidu ciary funds are: Pension Trust Fund s–The Comprehensive Fund accounts for the operations of the City’s pension  plans as described in Note 7. This is accounted for in the same manner as a proprietary fund type.  Measurement focus is upon determination of the change in net position and f inancial position. OPEB Trust Fund –Used to report resources held in trust for post -employment benefits other  than pension benefit for both the OPEB retiree plan and disabled firefighters plan. Private -Purpose Trust Fund –Accounts for assets held in trust for healthcare and worker’s  compensation benefits. Custodial Funds –Accounts for assets held for, and due to other governments or individuals for  whom it was collected. These funds are custodial in nature for holding tax refund s due to other  governments, escrow funds, and funds for a jointly governed entity. Custodial funds use the  economic resources measurement focus.  CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 31The basic financial statements also include the statement of net position and statement of  activities of the following component units: Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority Stadium Authority of the City of Pittsburgh Public Parking Authority of Pittsburgh Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh Budgetary Comparison Statements –The statements are presented to demonstrate whether  resources were obtained and used in accordance with the government’s legally adopted budget  for the General Fund and the Community Development Fund. The City revises the original budget  over the course of the year for various reasons. Under the current reporting model, budgetary  information continues to be provided and includes a comparison of the government’s original  adopted budget to the current comparison of final budg et and actual results. The City’s budget  is prepared on a non -GAAP basis as described in Note 2. (E)Basis of Accounting Basis of accounting refers to the point at which revenues and expenditures or expenses are  recognized in the accounts and reported in the financial statements. Basis of accounting relates  to the timing of the measurements made, regardless of the measuremen t focus applied. Governmental activities in the government -wide statement are presented using the economic  resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting, as are the fiduciary fund  financial statements. Revenues are recognized when earned, and expenses are recognized when  a liability has been incurred, regardless of the timing of related cash flows.  Governmental funds are accounted for using the current resource measurement focus and the  modified accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recognized when they become measurable  and available. General Fund taxrevenues are considered measurable when they have been  levied. To be considered available and thus susceptible to accrual, the real estate taxes must be  collected within the City’s period of availab ility of sixty (60) days. The portion of uncollected real  estate taxes that are deemed to be collectible at the end of this period are reported as deferred  inflows of resources . Interest income and intergover nmental receivables (state and federal   grants to the extent of allowable expenditures) are considered susceptible to accrual. The City  considers all non -real estate taxes and other revenues reported in the governmental fund to be  available if the revenues are collected within sixty (60) days. Expenditures are generally  recognized under the modified accrual basis of accounting when the related fund liability is  incurred. However, debt service expenditures, including lease payments, and other long -term   CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 32liabilities, such as workers’ compensation, accrued claims and judgements, and both short -and  long -term compensated abs ences are recorded only when payment is due and payable. General  capital asset acquisitions , including entering into contracts giving the City the right to use leased  assets, are reported as expenditures in governmental funds. Issuance of long -term debt and  financing through leases are reported as other financing sources.  The City generally uses restricted assets first for expenses incurred for which both restricted and  unrestricted assets are available. The City may defer the use ofrestricted assets based on a  review of the specific situation.  Non -exchange transactions, in which the City receives value without directly giving value in  return, include real estate and other taxes, grants, entitlements, and donations. On an accrual  basis, revenue from property taxes is recognized in the fiscal year for which the taxes are levied.  Revenue from grants, entitlements, and donations are recognized in the fiscal year in whic h all  eligibility requirements have been satisfied. Eligibility requirements include timing requirements,  which specify the year when the resources are required to be used or the year when use is firs t  permitted ; matching requirements, in which the City must provide local resources to be used for  specified purpose; and expenditure requirements, in which the resources are provide dto the City  on a reimbursement basis. On a modified accrual basis, revenue from non-exchange transactions   must be available before it can be recognized. (F) Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments, including trust and restricted  assets, with an original maturity of three months or less. Note 3, Deposits and Investments,  provides a detailed disclosure regarding cash, cash equivalents, and investments held by the City.  (G) Investments Investments in all funds are carried at fair value or amortized cost, as applicable .Investments  consist of a variety of investments including direct obligations of the U.S. government, money  market funds, corporate and other obligations, guaranteed investments, money market trust  funds, and repurchase agreements. Note 3, Deposit s and Investments, provides a detailed  disclosure regarding cash, cash equivalents, and investments. The City categorizes its fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy established by  generally accepted accounting principles. The hiera rchy is based on the valuation inputs used to  measure the fair value of the asset. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical  CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 33assets; Level 2 inputs are significant other observable inputs; Level 3 inputs are significant  unobservable inputs. (H) Due To/From Other Governments Outstanding balances between the City and other governments are reported as due to/from   other governments. (I) Taxpayer Ass essed Taxes Receivable Local wage taxes, payroll preparation tax, parking tax and other miscellaneous City taxes are  recorded in the City’s account s as taxpayer assessed receivables and revenue at the time of the  under lying transactions. In the government alfund statements, taxes for which there is an  enforceable legal claim as of December 31, 2023which were levied to financ e fiscal year 2023 operations have been recorded as deferred inflows of resources until such time as the taxes  become available on a modified accrual basis. Local wage taxes are collected by a third party in  accordance with PA Act 32.  (J) Other Receivables Other City accounts receivable, primar ily charges for services, are recorded in the City’s accounts  as other receivables when earned, less an allowance for uncollectible accounts. (K) Capital Assets and Leases Capital Assets Capital assets acquired or constructed by the City are reported in the government -wide financial  statements. Capital assets are recorded at historical cost or estimated historical cost (except for  the intangible right -to-use leased assets and subscription assets , the measurement of which is  discussed under Leases below). Capital assets are those assets with an initial individual cost of  more than $5,000 and estimated useful life in excess of one year. Gifts or contributions are  recorded at acquisition value when received . Depreciation is recorded on a straight -line basis  over the estimated useful life of each capital asset. No depreciation expense is recorded for land  and construction -in-progress. The value of the City’s art collection is indeterminable and would not be material to capital assets as a whole. The estimated useful lives for capital assets are as  follows: CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 34Furniture and fixtures   3-5   years Building and structures 25-50 years Equipment   2-10 years Infrastructure 20-50 years Vehicles   2-10 years Right -to-use leased assets      3-7 years Leases The City is a lessee for noncancellable leases of property and equipment. The City recognizes a  lease liability and an intangible right -to-use lease asset (lease asset) in the government -wide  financial statements for each of these leases. The City recognizes lease liabilities with an initial  individual value of $100,000 or more.  At the commencement of a lease, the City initially measures the lease liability at the present value  of payments expected to be made during the lease term. Subsequently, the lease liability is  reduced by the principal portion of lease payments made. The lease asset is initially measured as  the initial amount of the lease liability, adjusted for lease payments made at or before the lease  commencement date, plus certain initial direct costs. Subsequently , the lease asset is amortized  on a straight -line basis over its useful life.  Key estimates and judgements related to leases include how the City determines (1) the discount  rate it uses to discount the expected lease payments to present value, (2) lease term, and (3)  lease payments.  The City uses the interest rate charged by the lessor as the discount rate. When the  interest rate charged by the lessor is not provided, the City generally uses its estimated  incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate for leases.  The lease term includes the noncancellable period of the lease. Lease payments included  in the measurement of the lease liability are composed of fixed payment sand purchase  option price that the City is reasonably certain to exercise. The City monitors changes in circumstances that would require a remeasurement of its lease and  will remeasure the lease asset and liability if certain changes occur that are expected to  significantly affect the amount of the lease liability. Lease assets are reported with capital assets and lease liabilities are reported with long -term  debt on the statement of net position. CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 35Subscription -Based Information Technology Arrangements (SBITAs) A SBITA is defined as a contractual agreement that conveys control of the right to use another  party’s information technology (IT) software, alone or in combination with tangible capital assets  (the underlying IT assets), as specified in the contract for aminimum contractual period of greater  than one year, in an exchange or exchange -like transaction.  For the year ended December 31,  2023, the City evaluated its IT agreements and determined it had no material SBITAs to record. The only component unit that determined it had material SBITAs to report was PWSA.  PWSA  uses various SBITA assets that it contracts through cloud computing arrangements, such as  software as a service and platform as a service.  At the commencement of a new SBITA, PWSA  initially measures the subscription liability at the present value of payments expected to be made  during the subscription term.  Subsequently, the subscription liability is reduced by the principal  portion of subsc ription payments made.  PWS A has no variable payments (fixed in substance or  based on an index or rate), or termination penalties included within the subscription liability of  any SBITAs.  Variable payments based on future performance of a government, usage of the  underlying IT asse ts, or number of user seats are not included in the measurement of the  subscription liability and instead are recognized as outflows of resources in the period in which  the obligation for those payments is incurred.  The subscription asset is initially mea sured as the  initial amount of the subscription liability, adjusted for subscription payments made at or before  the subscription commencement date, plus capitalizable initial implementation costs.  In the  transition year of GASB Statement No. 96, governmen ts are permitted, but not required, to  include in the measurement of the subscription asset capitalizable outlays associated with the  initial implementation stage and the operation and additional implementation incurred prior to  the implementation of this Statement.  PWSA has elected to exclude any initial capitalizable  outlays incurred prior to January 1, 2022, in the measurement of the subscription assets at  January 1, 2022.  There are no subscription payments made at or before the SBITA  commencement or initial implementation costs included in the initial subscription asset  measured for any SBITAs.  Subsequently, the subscription asset is amortized on a straight -line  basis over the term of the SBITA. Key estimates and judgments related to SBITAs include how PWSA determines (1) the discount  rate it uses to discount the expected subscription payments to present value, (2) subscription term, and (3) subscription payments.  PWSA uses an estimated incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate for  SBITAs unless the interest rate charged by the provider is stated.  The discount  rate is used to determine the present value of subscription payments over the  subscription term. CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 36The subscription term is the noncancellable period of the SBITA.  This includes  periods in which there is an option to extend or terminate the subscription if it is  reasonably certain that the option will or will not be exercised.   Subscription payments included in the measurement of the subscription liability  are composed of fixed payments. PWSA monitors changes in circumstances that would require a remeasurement of its SBITAs and  will remeasure the subscription asset and liability if certain changes occur that are expected to  significantly affect the amount of the subscription liability.  The PWSA subscription assets are reported with non-utility capital assets and subscription liabilities are reported with leases/subscriptions payable on the component unit combining  statement of net position. (L) Deferred Outflows/Inflows of Resources In addition to assets , the statement of net position ,and/or the balance sheet will sometimes   report a separate section for deferred outflows of resources. This separate financial statement  element , deferred outflows of resources, represents a consumption of net assets and/or fund  balance that applies to a future period and so will not be recognized as an outflow of resources  (expense/expenditure) until then. The City and component units have three items that qualify  for reporting in this category: A deferred charge on refunding results from the difference in the carrying value of  refunded debt and its reacqui sition price. This amount is deferred and amortized over the  shorter of the life of the refunded or refunding debt. In conjunction with pension accounting requirements, deferred amounts relate to  differences between estimated and actual investment earnings, changes in actuarial  assumptions and other pension related changes.  This amount is determined based on  the actuarial valuation performed for the plan as described further in Note 7. In conjunction with OPEB accounting requirements, deferred amounts relate to  differences between estimated and actual investment earnings, changes in actuarial  assumptions and other OPEB related changes. These amounts are determined based on  the actuarial valuation performed for the plans as described further in Note 8.  In addition to liabilities, the statement of net position and/or balance sheet will sometimes report  a separate section for deferred inflows of resources .This separate financial statement element,   deferred inflows of resources, represents an acquisition of net assets/fund balance that applies  to a future period(s) and so will not be recognized as an inflow of resources (revenue) until tha t  CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 37time. The City has one type of item, which arises under a modified accrual basis of accounting  that qualifies for reporting in thiscategory . Accordingly, the item, unavailable revenue, is  reported only in the governmental funds balance sheet. The governmental funds report  unavailable revenues from property taxes , payroll preparation taxes and othe rtaxes. These  amounts are deferred and recognized as an inflow of resources in the period that the amounts  become available. Under the full accrual basis, the City and component units have items that  qualify for reporting in these catego ries: In conjunction with pension accounting requirements, deferred amounts relate to  differences between estimated and actual investment earnings, changes in actuarial  assumptions and other pension related changes.  These amounts are determined based  on the actuarial valuation performed for the plan as described further in Note 7. In conjunction with OPEB accounting requirements, deferred amounts relate to  differences between estimated and actual investment earnings, changes in actuarial  assumptions, and other OPEB related changes. These amo unts are determined based on  the actuarial valuation performed for the plans as described further in Note 8. Deferred amounts related to leases held as a lessor.  (M) Workers’ Compensation and Other Risk Management The City is self-insured for purposes of workers’ compensation benefits. Both short -and-long - term amounts payable are reported within the government -wide financial statements only. In order to qualify for and maintain self-insurance status, the City must comply with certain  Commonwealth requirements. The requirements for 2023 are as follows: Maintain an irrevocable trust fund. The City’s contribution to the fund is determined  annually in negotiation swith the Commonwealth Department of Labor. Satisfy the financial responsibility requirements of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Establish liability reserves based upon expected future payments for all claims  outstanding one year or more at the end of any fiscal year. Presently, the irrevocable trust may be used by the State of Pennsylvania only in the event of  default by the City under the self-insurance regulations. No risk financing activity is currently  being recorded in this trust fund. The City is self-insured for purpos es of health insurance coverage. An estimate ofincurred but  not reported liability is reported within the General Fund.  CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 38Component Unit : PWSA is also self -insur edfor general liability coverage and has established a Self-Insured Escrow  Fund (general liability) to cover potential liability claims.  (N) Compensated Absences It is the City’s policy to permit employees to accumulate earned but unused compensat ed  absences. For government -wide reporting, a liability is recorded for compensated absences when  services are rendered, and employees have earned the right to receive compensation for such  services.  Liabilities for compensated absences are not liquidated until leave is actually taken by employees  or leave balances are paid upon termination. Accordingly, in the fund financial statements for  governmental funds, no expenditure is reported for compensated absences until they are due  and payable. Current and non-current portions of compensated absences totaling $24, 893,443 are recorded in the government -wide financial statements and represent a reconciling item  between the government -wide and fund presentat ions.  (O) Pensions and Other Post -Employment Benefits In the government -wide financial statements, the City recognizes pension and other post - employment expenses in accordance with applicable standards. These expenditures are  recognized under the modified accrual basis within governmental funds to the extent of the City  contributions. Contributions made to the Pension Plan represent 100% of the PA Act 205 minimum municipal obligation plus, starting in 2010, additional contributions to increase the  funding level of the Plan. See Note 7 for pension and Note 8 fo r other post -employment benef its  for further disclosures.  (P) Long -term Obligations Long -term debt and other long -term obligations are reported as liabilities in governmental  activities in the statement of net position in the government -wide financial statements. Bond  premiums and discounts are amortized over the life of the bonds using the straight -line method  that approximates the effective interest method or the effective interest method itself. Bond  premiums and discounts are recorded as current period costs in the governmental funds.  CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 39(Q) Interfund Transactions On fund financial statements, receivables and payables resulting from outstanding balances involving other funds are classified as “Due from other Funds and Due to other Funds .” These  amounts are eliminated in the governmental column of the statement of net position. Flow of  cash or goods from one fund to another without a requirement for repayment is reported as  interfund transfers. Interfund transfers are reported as other financing sources/uses in  governmental funds. (R) Encumbrances The City uses encumbrance accounting for budgetary reporting, wherein purchase orders,  contracts, and other commi tments for the expenditure of funds are recorded to reserve that  portion of the applicable appropriation. Funding for all encumbrances lapses at year -end and re - appropriation is required by the City Council with the exception of capital fund project  encumbrances.  (S) Net Position Net position represents the difference between assets, deferred outflows and inflows of  resources and liabilities. Net investment in capital assets consists of capital assets, net of  accumulated depreciation, leases, and related debt used in the acquisition or construction of  capital assets. Net position is reported as restricted when there are limit ations imposed on its  use through the enabling legislation adopted by the City or through external restrictions imposed  by creditors, grantors, laws, or regulat ions of other governments. The City applies restricted  resources first when an expense is incurred for purposes for which both restricted and  unrestricted net position is available. Unrestricted net position is available for use in the current  period. The City may defer the use of restricted assets based on a review of the specific situation. (T) Use of Estimates Management of the City has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the  reporting of assets, liabilities, deferred inflows and outflows, revenues, expenses, and the  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare their financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Actual results may  differ from those estimates, particularly given the ongoing social and economic disrup tions and  uncertainties, and such differences may be material. CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 40(U) Fund Balance In the fund financial statements, governmental funds report fund balance in categories based on  the level of restriction placed upon the funds. These levels are as follows: Nonspendable –This category represents funds that are not in spendable form.  Restricted –This category represents funds that are limited in use due to constraints on  purpose and circumstances of spending that are legally enforceable by outside parties.  This category includes funds that are legally restricted for endowment earnings,  employee benefits, state and federal specific grants purposes, and for capital projects. Committed –This category represents funds that are limited in use due to constraints on  purpose and circumstances of spending imposed by City Council. Such commitment is  made via a Council resolution and must be made prior to the end of the fiscal year.  Removal of this commitment requires an equal action by Council. Committed funds   include funds for specified program services as defined by the creation of the fund and  interfund advance.  Assigned –This category represents intentions of the City to use the funds for specific  purposes. This category includes encumbrances and funds remaining for debt service. The  City’s Ch arter requires City Council to approve a Resolution to set up encumbrances. The  encumbrances are then submitted to individual department Directors for execution.  Unassigned –This category represents all other funds not otherwise defined for the  General Fund. The General Fund is the only fund that reports a positive unassigned fund  balance amount. It is t he City’s policy to consider restricted fund balance to have been depleted before using any  of the component sof unrestricted fund balance. Further, when the components of unrestricted  fund balance can be used for the same purpose, committed fund balance is depleted first,  followed by assigned fund balance. Unassigned fund balance is applied last.  (V) Pending Pronouncements GASB has issued the following statements that will become effective in future years as shown  below. Management has not yet determined the impact of these statements on the City’s  financial statements: GASB Statement No. 99, “Omnibus 2022,” is effective for various items through fiscal years   beginning after June 15, 2023. This statement includes additional guidance related to extension  of use of LIBOR, nonmonetary transactions, pledges of future revenue, leases , SBITAs, financial   guarantees, and derivative instruments.  CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 41GASB Statement No. 100, “Accounting Changes and Error Correction),” is effective for fiscal years  beginning after June 15, 2023. This statement provides guidance to enhance accounting and  financial reporting requirements for accounting changes and error corrections. GASB Statement No. 101, “Compensated Absences,” is effective for fiscal years beginning after  December 15, 2023. This statement provides guidance by updating the recognition and  measur ement guidance for compensated absences. GASB Statement No. 102, “Certain Risk Disclosures ,”is effective for fiscal years beginning after  June 15, 2024. This statement requires a government to assess whether a concentration or  constraint makes the primary government reporting unit or other reporting units that report a  liability for revenue debt vulnerable to the risk of substantial impact . (W) Adoption of Pronouncements GASB Statement No. 94, “Public -Private and Public -Public Partnerships and Availability Payment  Arrangements,” is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2022. This statement  addresses issues related to public -private and public -public partnership arrangements and  provides guidance on accounting and reporting for availability payment arrangements. This statement had no significant impact on the City’s financial statements for the year ended  December 31, 2023.  GASB Statement No. 96, “Subscription -Based Information Technology Arrangements (SBITAs),” is  effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2022. This statement provides guidance on  accounting and financial reporting for subscription -based information technology arrangements  for government end users. This statement had no significant impa ct on the City’s financial  statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. The component units determined that there was no material impact to their financial statements  for the implementation of GASB Statement No. 94.  The SBITAs standard (GASB Statement No.  96)was also adopted and implemented as appropriate by the component units.  Component Unit Disclosures : Property Held for Redev elopment Property held for redevelopment relates mainly to land and buildings held by the URA that is  available for redevelopment. Depending on the nature of the redevelopment activity, the  transfer of this property may consist of many forms: grant, subsidized or below -market sale, or  CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 42an independent, market -based sale. This property is held at cost or estimated net realizable  value, ifless than cost. Estimated net realizable value is calculated once plans or disposition  agreements are in place to dispose of property at less than cost. When assets are sold, the  proceeds are either returned to the program to further its purposes or returned to the grantor  agency that funde dthe original purchase.  Loans Receivable URA loans receivable are recognized when the loan is established for loans with terms of thirty  years or less. Loans with amortization terms greater than th irty years or which are repayable on  a contingent basis, such as the sale of the property or completion of development, are treated  as gr antsfor accounting purposes and are recorded as expenditures when disbursed or are fully  reserved. It is the URA’s policy to provide for future losses on loans based on an evaluation of the current  loan portfolio, current economic conditions, and such other factors which, in the URA’s  judgement, may impact collectability. As of December 31, 2023, the total allowance for  uncollectible loans, including those only repayable on a contingent basis and fully reserved at the  time of issuance, was $18 4million.  Other Long -term Liabilities An Agreement of Sale in Lieu of Condemnation (Agreement) was executed on April 14, 2004 between the Public Parking Authority and Greyhound Lines, Inc. (Greyhound). As stipulated in  the Agreement, th ePublic Parking Authority purchased from Greyhound the property located at  the corner of Liberty Avenue and 11thstreet for the purchase price of $6,242,000, which was  immediately remitted to the Public Parking Authority for the construction of the bus terminal.  Greyhound leases the bus terminal from the Public Parking Authority for an annual base rent of  $1 for an initial term of 30 years. There are three consec utive 10-year extension terms, each with  an annual base rent of $100,000. The $6,242,000 is being recognized as revenue over the term  of the lease, which commenced on October 1, 2008. The balance of unearned rent/revenue at  December 31, 2023is $3,068,981 .  The lease portion of this transaction is not considered material  and is thus not reflected under GASB 87. Lease Receivables The Parking Authority is a lessor for several noncancellable leases of space within their buildings  and parking garages, the Stadium Authority is a lessor for a noncancellable lease of retail space  and the URA is a lessor for various noncancellable leases of parking garage/lots and land. Each  CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 43Authority recognizes a lease receivable and a deferred inflow of resources on the statement of  net position for those lease agreements that extend beyond a 12 -month period. At the commencement of a qualifying lease, each Authority initially measures the lease  receivable at the present value of payments expected to be received during the lease term.  Subsequently, the lease receivable is reduced by the principal portion of lease payments  received. The deferred inflow of resources is initially measured as the initial amount of the lease  receivable, adjusted for lease payments received at or before the lease commencement date.  Subsequently, the deferred inflow of resources is reco gnized as revenue over the life of the lease  term. As of December 31, 2023, the Parking Authority’s receivable for lease payments was  $2,010,847 and deferred inflow of resources was $1,655,173 . As of December 31, 2023, the  Stadium Authority’s receivable for lease payments was $827,797 and deferred inflow of  resources was $ 752,378 . As of December 31, 202 3, the URA’s receivable for lease payments was  $33,887,325 and deferred inflow of resources was $3 3,190,708 . Special Item The PWSA has recorded a special item for private line lead replacements. In accordance with  GASB No. 34, a special item is defined as an expenditure within control of management and either  unusual or infrequent in occurrence. The PWSA has determined that private lead line  replacements qualify as a special item. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the PWSA  received approximately $3.1million in federal grants for private lead line replacement that is  recorded net of the special item expense. Budgets and Budgetary Accounting 1.  General Budget Policies –As required by the Home Rule Charter, the City follows these  procedures in establishing the budgetary data reflected in the financial statement: a.  On the second Monday of November preceding the fiscal year, the Mayor presents to City  Council a General Fund and Community Development Fund operating budget and a capital  budget for the su cceeding fiscal year.  b.  Public hearings are conducted to obtain the advice of other officials and citizens as part of the  preparation of these budgets. c.  Before the beginning of the fiscal year, City Council adopts , by resolution, these budgets. CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 44d.  The adoption of the operat ing and capital budgets constitutes an appropriation or setting  apart of funds from general resources of the City for purposes set forth in the budgets.  e.  City Council may amend, by resolution, the operating budget within five weeks after the  beginning of the fiscal year, but not thereafter except with the approval of the Mayor. The capital  budget may, by resolution, be amended by City Council at any time.  f. City Council at all times may, by resolution, transfer funds from one account to another if the  total operating budget amount is not exceeded. No revision to the budget may be made without  City Council approval. The operating budget shall ,in any event, remain balanced at all times. g.  The capital budget is generally based on a proposed six-year capital program , which must be  updated each year and submitted to City Council by the Mayor at least 30 days prior to the day  the operating budget is submitted. The capital budget also includes appropriations for the  Community Development Fund. Budget and actual data for the Community Development Fund  is reflected in the Community Development Fund. The remainder of the capital budget is  reflected in the Capital Projects Fund. h.  Formal budgetary integration is employed as management control device for the General, the  Community Development, andthe Capital Projects Funds . Formal budgetary integration is not  employed for the debt service fund since effective budgetary control is alternatively achieved  through general obligation bond indenture provisions, nor for the other governmental funds  since control is prepared on a project basis. For the American Rescue Plan Act Fund, the City has  prep ared a City Council approved spending plan based on allowable expenditures. The General,  Community Development, and Capital Projects Funds have legally adopted annual budgets. i.  All budgets are prepared and controlled at the department level by subclass. The Budget Office  reviewed all budget deficits and monitored budget to actual by subclass during the year. Further  refinement of the budget control matters is expected to be addressed in a future year. Due to  the voluminous number of projects, separately issue dline item capital budget reports are  available from the City Controller’s Office. j. Operating appropriations lapse at year -end. City Council can, however, authorize, by resolution,  the carryover of appropriations to the following year. The Community Development and Capital  Projects Funds appropriations carry over to subsequent years without formal re -appropriation. k.  Operation budget figures are amended by City Council with Mayoral approval. These budget  amendments represent additional unanticipated federal funding, line item transfers between  expenditures accounts and carryover of appropriations from the previous year. The approved  CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 45original General Fund budget includes revenues of $686.5 million and expenditures of  approximately $656.7 million in 2023. The budgetary expenditures, as amended, increased for  carryover appropriation and other changes approved by City Council during 2023of $33.0 million;  budgeted revenues , as amended, were increased to $697.6 million during 2023 . 2. Budgetary Basis of Accounting –The General Fund budget is adopted on a cash basis.  Budgeted encumbrances for purchase commitments are treated as restrictions of available cash  and as expenditures. Budgets in Capital Projects Funds are also adopted on a cash basis, except  that budgets for each project are adopted on a project basis, which may encompass a period  longer than one year. Accordingly, budget figures, as amended, for Community Development and  Capital Projects Funds reflect current year appropr iations and unexpe nded prior year’s  appropriations. 3.  Excess Expenditures over Appropriations -The City had negative variances in the salaries and  benefits line item forCommission on Human Relations and three public safety departments  (Emergency Medical Services , Bureau of Fire , and Animal Control )in the General Fund where the  amount spent exceeded the budget. The excess expenditures were covered primarily by favorable budget variances in other   expenditure categories . For 202 3, the City decided to show the variances rather than amend the  budget. Deposit s and Investments Both Pennsylvania statutes and City code provide guidelines for investment of governmental  funds into certain authorized investment types including U.S. Treasury bills, other short -term U.S.  and Pennsylvania government obligations, short term commercial paper issued by a public  corporation, banker’s acceptances, insured or collater alized time deposits, and certificates of  deposit. Both allow the pooling of funds for investment purposes. Neither the statutes, nor City  code prescribe regulations related to demand deposits ; however, all depositories of City funds  must meet qualifying criteria set forth in Section 223 of the City code. The investment policy of the City compliments state statutes and adheres to prudent business  practice. There were no investment transactions during the year that were in violation of either  the state statutes or the policy of the City.  CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 46(A) Primary Government Funds and Custodial Funds Cash balances available for investment by most City funds are maintained in pooled bank and  investment accounts to improve investment opportunities. Income from investment of pooled  cash is recorded in the General Fund. Certain unrestricted and restricted cash and short -term  investment balances in the accompanying balance sheet represent the undivided interest of each  respective fund in the pooled accounts.  Investment policies permit the City to invest in the following: 1.U.S. Treasury Securities (bills, notes, bonds) . 2.Obligations of specific agencies of the federal government where principal and interest are  guaranteed by the U.S. government. 3.Fully insured or collateralized certificates of deposit at commercial banks and savings and  loan associations accepted as depository institutions under the Pittsburgh City Code. 4.Money market mutual funds authorized by City Council whose portfolio consists of  government securities issued by the U.S. government and that are fully guaranteed as to  principal and interest. 5.Local government investment pools and or trusts as approved by the state legislature or City  Council from time to time. 6.Repurchase agreements collateralized by the U.S. Treasury securities and marked to market.  In order to participate in the repurchase agreement market, a depository must execute a  master repurchase agreement contract with the City. To ensure adequate liquidity, at least 10% but no more than 40% of the portfolio shall be in  overnight repurchase agreements, money market funds, or other secure and liquid forms of  acceptable investments. Unless specifically matched to a cash flow, at lea st 20% of the portfolio  shall mature within 91 days with the maximum maturity of any investment to be no longer than  one year from the date of purchase unless specifically approved in writing by the Director of  Finance. The City maintains compensating balances with some of its depository banks to offset specific  charges for check clearing and other services.

PLGIT and PA INVEST are reported at amortized cost, which approx imates market. The City can  withdraw PLGIT and PA INVEST funds without limitations or fees. Governmental Funds Custodial Credit Risk –Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the event of a bank or counterparty  failure, the City’s funds may not be returned to it. The City policy does not specifically address  custodial credit risk. As of December 31, 2023, $571,197,167 of the City’s combined bank  balances of $574,197,167 subject to custodial credit risk were exposed to custodial credit risk,  which is collateralized in accordance with Act 72 of the Pennsylvania state legislature, which  requires the institution to pool collateral for all governmental deposits and have the collateral  held by an approved custodian in the institution’s name.  Interest Rate Risk –The City’s investment policy limits investment maturities as a means of  managing its expos ure to fair value losses arising from increasing interest rates ;the City  investments must have maturities no greater than ten years within the constraint of meeting  cash flow requirements. As of December 31, 2023, the City’s exposure to interest rate risk was  limited to $ 57,699,000 , 10% of deposit and investment funds available, with a weighted average  maturity period of 40days.

CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 48Credit Risk –The City’s investment policy limits its investment choices based on government  backed instruments and credit rating s by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations.  $8,500,000 of the City’s Private -Purpose Trust and Custodial Funds cash and cash equivalents are  held in U.S. Treasuries and are therefore not exposed to this type of risk. (B)Pension Trust Deposits are maintained by all entities within the Funds. The Comprehensive Municipal Pension  Trust Fund (CMPTF) holds all investment vehicles on behalf of the Funds. The CMPTF was  established on January 1, 1988 by combining the assets and liabilities of the three prior investment plans representing the City of Pittsburgh Police and Fire Departments and Non - uniformed Municipal workers in order to provide a consolidated investment strate gy to support  the City of Pittsburgh pension obligation. The CMPTF is governed by a formal investment policy established by its Board of Directors  (Board). The policy dictates that investments must be managed in a manner consistent with the   Pennsylvania Municipal Pension Plan Funding Standard and Recovery Act (Act 205) and the  Pennsylvania Fiduciaries Code. The policy covers the two components of the CMPTF : 1) the  Operating Fund and 2) the Long -Term Assets. The Operating Fund is a liquid ity pool to accept  employee, employer and supplemental state contribution s and to make benefit disbursements.  As such, the Operating Fund investments are restricted to high quality, very short duration fixed  income instruments whose average maturity must not exceed six months and whose quality is  restricted to investment grade and above securities. The Long -Term Asset component includes  restrictions on both fixed income and equity investments as discussed below in further detail in  thisfootnote.  Deposits Custodial Credit Risk –For a deposit, custodial credit risk isthe risk that in the event of a bank  failure, the combined deposits of the City’s pension funds may not be returned to it. There are  no formal deposit policies specifically addressing custodial credit risk.  As of December 31, 2023, $760,888 of the City’s pension cash account deposits of the $4,040,077 combined bank balance was insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The  remaining bank balance was exposed to custodial credit risk, which is collateralized in accordance  with Act 72 of the Pennsylvania state legislature, which requires the institution to pool collateral  for all governmental deposits and have the collateral held by an approved custodian in the  institution’s name . $3,839,509 of cash and cash equivalents were held at December 31, 2023in  the separate pension funds. CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 49Investments Long -term investments are all held by the CMPTF and are stated at fair value. These investments  are assigned to professional asset managers that specialize in certain types ofinvestments with  oversight by an outside investment consultant and the Board in order to achieve an appropriate,  diversified and balanced asset class mix to minimize portfolio risk. The Investment Policy of the CMPTF dictates an allocation of 60% equity , 40% fixed income with  a variation of 10% above or below these targets for each classification. At December 31, 2023,  the CMPTF had been in compliance with this policy. Within each investment category there are  specific policies to further address various types of risk compared to return. The investment  advisors monitor compliance with the City’s investment policy on a granular level that is different  from the table below.  The CMPTF’s pension trust fund categori zes its fair value measurements within the fair value  hierarchy established by generally accepted accounting principles.

Corporate debt is valued using a matrix pricing model and are included in the Level 2  fair value hierarchy. The fair values of FNMA, GNMA, and FHLM securities are priced by third  party pricing services using observable market data and are included in the Level 2 fair value  hierarchy. As the yields for the risk-free yield curve and the spreads for these securities are  observable market inputs, the fair values are included in the Level 2 fair value hierarchy. For Level 3 items, the CMPTF’s valuation is determined in good faith from information provided  by the General Partner of the limited partnerships. Fairvalue for the limited partnerships is based on the best information available and is determined using information including, but not limited  to, the following: projected sales, net earnings, earning s before interest, taxes, depreciation and  amortization, balance sheets, public or private transactions, valuations for public ly-traded comparable companies, and/ or other measures, and consideration of any other pertinent  information including the types of securities heldand restrict ions on disposition. Quantitative  unobservable inputs of Level 3 items are not developed by the CMPTF for measuring fair value.

Barings Core Property Fund is a real estate fund that specializes in property investments in United  States. The preceding methods described may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative  of net realizable value or reflective of the future fair values. Furthermore, although the trust fund  believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants ,  the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine fair value of certain financial  instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. Concentration of Credit Risk –The Comprehensive Trust investment guidelines address this risk  by requiring diversity and investment percentage limits. With the exception of Federal  Government and Agency obligations , no one issue will comprise more than 10% of the aggregate  fixed -income portfolio without the Board’s prior approval. In addition, equity investment  concentration in any single industry and in any company shall not exceed 25% and 5%, respectively, of the market value of the plan assets. To furth er reduce risk, diversification will also  be achieved by using multiple managers whose styles and strategies are sufficiently distinctive.  International managers may be allocate dup to 30% of the plan’s equity assets, and up to 50% of  this allocation may be allocated to emerging markets investments. As of December 31, 202 3, the  Comprehensive Trust is in compliance with these limits.

Transactions with the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA) In July 1995, the City entered into a Cooperati onAgreement and a Capital Lease Agreement  (collectively referred to as the Agreements with PWSA). The Cooperation Agreement was  renegotiated by the PWSA Board of Directors and the City Mayor’s Office. (A) Cooperation Agreement Under the terms of the original Cooperation Agreement, City Water Department employees  became employees of the PWSA . As a result, the PWSA assumed various obligations from the  City. The City and the PWSA provided various services to each other in accordance with the  CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 62Cooperation Agreement , and the PWSA reimbursed the City for direct and indirect costs  attributed by the City to the operation and maintenance of the System. Under the original Agreement, PWSA provided up to 600 million gallons of water annually for the  City’s use without charge . Also, the PWSA assumed the City’s obligation for the cost of subsidizing   water service to those residents of the City situated beyond PWSA’s service area so that those  water users pay charges that mirror the rates of PWSA. On February 4, 2019, PWSA’s Board issued a resolution that the existing Cooperation Agreement  shall be terminated in accordance with the terms of the agreement, 90 days after the approval  of the resolution .City and PWSA officials collaborated on a new Cooperation Agreement to  further implement efficiencies and improvements, including :permitting PWSA to reimburse the  City for pension costs for PWSA employees covered by the City’s pension plans , allowing the City  to charge the PWSA the usual rates that other utilities pay for permit fees, and charging the City  for water, stormwater , wastewater coveyance , and ALCOSAN usage, with a five-year phase -in  starting in 2020 for water and wastewater charges only. The PWSA board implemented the new  Cooperation Agreement as of October 3, 2019. This agreement has been filed with the  Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (Commission) according to Title 66, §507 of the Public  Utility Code, and can be modified by order of the Commission. On July 23, 2020, Penns ylvania Act  70 (Act 70) was signed into law. Act 70 provides that the Cooperation Agreement shall have the  force and effect of law until January 1, 2025 , or an earlier termination date to which the City and  the PWSA mutually agree.  (B) System Lease The City and PWSA entered into a Capital Lease Agreement (Capital Lease), effective July 27,  1995, with a term of thirty years, commencing as of July 15,1995 and ending on September 1,  2025. The Capital Lease stipulates minimum lease payments of approximately $101,000,000,  including interest, all of which were satisfied during the initial three years ofthe capital lease.  PWSA has the option to purchase the System in 2025 for $1. (C) Pension As of December 31, 2023, the City has retained the pension obligation for PWSA’s employees  who participat e in the City’s Municipal Pension Plan. The extent of PWSA’s participation in such  obligation with respect to these employees whose membership continued upon becoming  employees of PWSA, as well as new members, is determined by the Cooperation Agreement.  CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 63The City and PWSA determined upon a payment of approximately $4.5million for the PWSA’s  share of the City’s current pension costs for the year ended December 31, 2023. The PWSA’s  payment was calculated based on the percentage of its covered payroll to the total covered  payroll, which approximates 1 6.3%. See additional related party transaction disclosures for the URA, Stadium Authority, and Parking  Authority in Note 13. Real Estate Taxes Real Estate Taxes The City has the power to levy and collect ad valorem taxes on all taxable real estate within its  boundaries. Real estate is assessed by Allegheny Count y Office of Property Assessment pursuant  to the terms of the General County Assessment Law and the Second Class County Assessment  Law, which require property to be assessed atactual market value. Property is assessed by the  Board at 100% of fair market value. The taxa ble assessed value for 202 3was $21, 659,143,000. A unified tax levy for land and buildings is made annually on January 1 and collected by the City.  Taxes are payable annually or in three installments, at the taxpayers’ option, normally due the  last day of February, April 30, and July 31. A 2%discount is allowed on either the first installment  or the full year tax payment, normally if paid by February 10. If no payment is received by the last  day of February , the installment payment privilege is forfeited, and the entire tax for the year is  considered del inquent. Penalty and interest are imposed on the property at time of lien. Property Tax Re assessments The City taxes land and building sat the same unified rate and plans to maintain a unified rate  unless land values are reassessed in the future. A court -ordered reassessment for Allegheny  County, including the City of Pittsburgh , occurred during 2012. These reass essed values will  continue to be used until the next reassessment. No “windfall” to the municipality can occur due  to state law.  City and School Real Estate Taxes (property taxes) are based on the assessed value of the  property as determined by the Allegheny County Board of Assessors. The assessed value of a  property is broken down by land value and building value. For 202 3, the City’s tax rate was 8.06  mills for general purposes and 0.50 for parks on the assessed value of the property. The School   District of Pittsburgh’s tax rate was 10.25 mills on the assessed value . A mill is 1/10 of a cent. For  CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 64example, on a property assessed at $1,000, the City Real Estate tax would be $8.56. The School  District of Pittsburgh Real Estate Tax would be $10.25. Taxes are billed on a calendar year. The City has accrued for tax refunds and tax credits within accounts payable on the statement of  net position and governmental funds balance sheet (General Fund) for payment sreceived that  aresubject to refund. Tax Abatements The City’s tax abat ements are authorized by City Council ordinance. Recipients are eligible for tax  abatement for various reasons such as development costs, property location, or renovations that  would otherwise result in increased property assessment.

Investments of the plans are held by the Comprehensive Municipal Pension  Trust Fund (Comprehensive Trust) , in accordance with the Municipal Pension Plan Funding  Standard and Recovery Act of 1984 9 (Act 205) and are administered under the direction of th at fund ’sBoard . In accordance with Act 205 andthe Acts under which the Municipal Pension Plan of the City of  Pittsburgh, the Policemen’s Relief and Pension Plan of the City of Pittsburgh, and the Firemen’s  Relief a nd Pension Plan of the City of Pittsburgh were established; a separate accounting for the  activities of these three plans is maintained including the employees’ contributions, allocation of  state aid and the City’s annual contribution and a calculation of each Plan’s undivided interest in  the investments held bythe Comprehensive Trust. Additionally, separate actuarial valuations are  performed annually for each plan. However, the individual plans do not record the undivide d  interest in the investments in their individual plans since the assets of the Comprehensive Trust  are available for the payments of benefits and expenses of any of the three pension plans without  limitations. Therefore, in accordance with Governmental Accounting Standards , the City is  considered to be administering a single plan for financial r eporting purposes. The three pension  plans plus the Comprehensive Trust constitute the City’s Pension Plan.  The retirement plans issue a publicly available combined financial report that includes financial   statements and required supplementary information.  This report may be obtained by contacting  the following:  City of Pittsburgh Combined Pension Fund C/O Department of Finance City/County Building Pittsburgh, PA 15219 Key provisions of the Municipal Pension Fund, the Policemen’s Fund, and the Firemen’s Fund are  summ arized below. The actual plan provisions should be reviewed to capture all the detail s. CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 70The Municipal Pension Plan The Municipal Pension Plan of the City of Pittsburgh (Municipal Plan) was establish edby Act 259  of May 28, 1915 , P.L. 596. Every full -time employee of the City and the PWSA who is not covered  by the Policemen’s Plan or the Firemen’s Plan is required to join the Municipal Plan after serving  a 90-day probationary period. Participation in the Municipal Plan is closed to non-union PWSA  employees hired after March 1,2019. The Municipal Plan is a single employer defined benefit  plan, and its purpose is to provi de retirement, disability, and other benefits to its members. The  City and members of the Municipal Plan are required to make contributions to the Municipal Plan  for the purpose of paying benefits and administrative expenses. At January 1, 2023, the date of  the most recent actuarial valuation, the Municipal Fund has 3,730 total members, of which 1,806 are active members ;1,697are inactive plan members or beneficiaries currently receiving  benefits; and 227 are inactive plan members entitled to but not yet r eceiving benefits. Effective January 1, 1995, the City terminated employment of the 255 employees of its Water  Department. As part of a Cooperation Agreement with PWSA , the 255 terminated employees  became employees of PWSA. The PWSA employees’ membership in the Municipal Plan continued  with no break in service, as provided for by the Municipal Pension Act, because PWSA had no  retirement plan. The City considers PWSA a part of the reporting entity and thus the plan  continues to be a single employer plan. Contributions are calculated based on the Cooperation  Agreement. As of the date of these financial statements, the Plan has not reported or attributed  measurements of assets or the net pension liability on the basis of the grou pof members who  are PWSA employ ees. As of December 31, 2023, the PWSA and the City have not determined the  ultimate amount to be paid (the PWSA’s proportion of the City’s net pension liability) by the  PWSA pen ding completion of an actuarial study. The PWSA is estimating their proportion of the   net pension liability to be between $20 and $30 million.  As discussed in Note 4, on February 4, 2019 , the PWSA’s Board issued a resolution that the  existing Cooperation Agreement shall be terminated in accordance with the terms of the  agreement, 90 days after the approval of the resolution. City and PWSA officials have  collaborated on a New Cooperation Agreement to further implement efficiencies and  improvements, including requir ing the PWSA to reimburse the City for pension costs for PWSA   employees covered by the City’s pension plan, with a five-year -phase -in starting in 2020. The  PWSA Board implemented the new Cooperation Agreement as of October 3, 2019 . The City and  PWSA determined upon payment of approximately $4.4 million for the PWSA’s share of the City’s  pension costs, prior to adjustment for the PWSA’s portion of the state aid received by the City  for pension costs, for the year -ended December 31, 2023. The PWSA’s payment was calculated  based on the percentage of its covered payroll to the tota lcovered payroll, which approximates   15.3 %.

CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 74(B) Funding Status and Progress In accordance with the Municipal Pension Plan Funding Standard and Recovery Act of 1984 (Act  205), the City established the Comprehensive Municipal Pension Trust Fund Board  (Comprehensive Trust) in August 1987. The Board’s purpose is to oversee the activities of the  City’s pension plans and to receive and invest the City’s pension assets. The City has three defined benefit pension plans (Municipal, Policemen, and Firemen) , which are  administered by respective pension boards, the majority of whose members are elected by the  employees. The Policemen and Firemen Plans cover all employees of the Bureau of Police and  the Bureau of Fire, respectively. Each full-time employee not covered under either the  Policemen’s or Firemen’s Plan is required to join the Municipal Plan after serving a 90-day  probationary period.  Act 205 contains both mandatory and optional remedies for municipalities to design a program  for dealing with unfunded pension liabilities. The mandatory remedies implemented by the City  were the development and adoption of an administrative improvement plan for its pension fund,  the establishment of lower cost pension plans for new hires, and the aggregation of all the City’s pension assets for investment purposes under the guidance of an oversight board (the  Comprehensive Municipal Pension Trust Fund Boar d). The Comprehensive Trust , which is  comprised of seven members, four appointed by the Mayor and approved by Council and one  elected from each plan, manages the investments of all pension assets and provides funds for  each plan’s monthly payment of benefits and administrative expenses from plan net position.  The optional remedies initially selected by the City were: 40-year amortization of the unfunded  liability, level percen tamorti zation, and a 15-year phase -in allowing the City to gradually increase  its pension contributions. The Plans are funded by the City on an annual basis pursuant to the provisions of Act 205. Act  205 requires that annual contributions be based upon the calculation of the Minimum Municipal  Obligation (MMO). Employees are not required to contribute under Act 205; such contributions  are subject to collective bargaining and can be reduced or eliminated each year by Ordinance or  Resolution subject to the Plans meeting certain financial conditions. The Commonwealth of  Pennsylvania (Commonwealth) allocates certai n funds to assis tin pension funding. Any financial  requirement established by the MMO which exceeds the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania  allocation must be funded by the City. The MMOs for each of the three plans for December 31,  2023were $1 7,265,749 Municipal, $8,161,974 Policemen , and $ 31,113,771 Firemen. CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 75Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Act 44 of 2009 required the City’s aggregate pension funding  level to be at least 50 percent by December 31, 2010 to avoid having the City’s pension funds  seized and administered by the Pennsylvania Municipal Retirement System .The City’s plan to  meet th is level of funding included transferring approximately $45 million to the Comprehensive  Trust Fund which was in the Debt Service Reserve Fund in 2010 and dedicating parking tax  revenues for the next 31 years per Council legislation. During 2021, Council l egislation extended  the parking tax payments five more years. The City contributed parking tax revenues of $13.4  million per year from 2011 through 2017 and $26.8 million from 2018 through 2021. The City will  continue to contribute $26.8 million per year from 2022 through 2046. While the present value  of the dedicated future parking tax revenues for future pension contributions did not meet the  criteria for recognition as an asset in the City’s financial statements or those of the  Comprehensive Trust Fund, it was treated as an actuarial asset for purposes of funding levels  under Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Act 44 of 2009 and the City was determined to have met  the required funding level to avoid takeover of the City pensions by the Pennsylvania Municipal  Retirement System and the parking revenue stream continues t obe treated as an actuarial asset  for funding purposes.  For the year ended December 31, 2023,on an accrual basis, the City did contribute $106.1million  to the Pension Trus tFund paid from the General Fund. Contribution funding by the General Fund  is consistent with prior years. Contributions made to the Plan represent 100% of the Act 205  MMO of $56.5million plus additional contributions of $49.6million including $26.8 million of  dedicated parking tax revenue, $19. 4million in gaming funds, and $3.4million related to other  benefits.

Changes in benefit terms –For the Municipal Fund, effective January 1, 2022, the member  contribution rate was changed to 6% for all full-time non-union members hired on or after  January 1, 2022 or those irrevocably electing to remove the Social Security offset.  There were no  changes to benefit terms made in connection with the 1/1/2023 actuarial valuations for the Fire  and Police funds. Long -Term Expected Rate of Return –The long -term expected rate of return on Plan investments  was determined using a building -block method in which best -estimate ranges of expected future  real rates of return (expected returns, net of pension plan investment expense and inflation) are  developed for each major asset class. These ranges are combined to produce the long -term  expected rate of return by weighting the expected future real rates of return by the target asset  allocation percentage and by adding expected inflation. CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 78The following was the asset allocation policy and best estimates of arithmetic real rates of return  for each major asset class included in the Plans’ target asset allocation as of December 31, 202 3: Long-Term Expected Target Allocation Real Rate of Return Asset Class Domestic equity 37.00% 4.5-5.4% International equity 20.00% 5.0-5.4% Hedge funds 8.00% 4.8-8.5% Real assets 8.00% 4.8-8.5% Private equity 5.00% 4.8-8.5% Fixed income 22.00% 1.5-2.5% Cash 0.00% 0.0-1.5% 100.00% Rate of Return –The money -weighted rate of return expresses investment performance, net of  investment expense, adjusted for the changing amounts actually invested. For the year ended  December 31, 2023, the annual money -weighted rate of return on the Plan investments, net of  investment expense, 11.4% . Discount Rate –The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability for the Municipal,  Policemen, and Firemen funds was 7.00%. The projection of cash flows used to determine the  discount rate assumed that plan member contributions will be made at the current contribution rate, parking tax revenue will be deposited in accordance with Ordinances 42 and 44 of 2010,   and that the City’s contributions will be made equal to the yearly MMO calculation. Based on  those assumptions, the pension plan’s fiduci ary net position was projected to be available to  make all projected future benefit payments of current plan members. Therefore, the long -term  expected rate of return on pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension liability (i.e. no depletion isprojected to occur). Sensitivity of the net pension liability to changes in the discount rate –The following presents the  net pension liability of theCity calculated using the discount rates described above, as well as  what the City’s net pension liabilities would be if they were calculated using a discount rate that  is one -percentage -point lower or one -percentage -point higher than the current rates: CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 791% Dec rease Current Disc ount 1% Increase (6.00%) Rate (7.00%) (8.00%) Munic ipal 213,179,968 $              170,375,108 $                     133,990,679 $             Policemen 385,908,782                 326,331,585                         276,121,345                Firemen 382,076,164                 320,321,127                         267,860,926                Total 981,164,914 $              817,027,820 $                     677,972,950 $             Pension Expense and Deferred Outflow of Resources and Deferred Inflows of Resources  Related to Pensions For the year ended December 31, 202 3, the City recognized pension expense o f$81,914,057 .At  December 31, 2023, the City reported deferred outflows ofresources and deferred inflows of  resources related to pensions from the following sources: Municipal Policemen Firemen Total Deferred outflows of resources: Changes of assumptions 5,193,506 $       9,120,170 $       21,017,588$   35,331,264 $           Net difference between projected and actual   earnings on pension plan investments 6,405,402          6,154,144           6,171,041         18,730,587              Difference between expected and actual   experience 2,947,835          3,170,180           8,664,771         14,782,786             -                            Total deferred outflows of resources 14,546,743$     18,444,494$     35,853,400$   68,844,637 $           Deferred inflows of resources: Difference between expected and actual   experience (37,245,098)$   (5,188,869) $      (3,511,739)$    (45,945,706) $          Total deferred inflows of resources (37,245,098)$   (5,188,869) $      (3,511,739)$    (45,945,706) $          CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 80Amounts reported as deferred outflows and deferred inflows of resources related to pension will  be recognized in pension expense as follows: Munic ipal Policemen Firemen Total 2024 (3,037,601) $        3,383,720 $             13,084,573 $       13,430,692 $                  2025 (4,150,871)           4,771,387                15,322,939          15,943,455                      2026 (3,348,665)           6,611,863                7,997,283             11,260,481                      2027 (12,161,218)         (1,511,345)               (3,500,624)           (17,173,187)                    Therea fter -                            -                                (562,510)               (562,510)                          (22,698,355) $     13,255,625 $          32,341,661 $       22,898,931 $                  Component Units : Single -Employer Defin ed Benefit Plan –Parking Authority General Information .

CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 87Changes in Actuarial Assumptions Pre-Medicare trends have been increased to 7.0% for 2023 -2025 to reflect expectations arising  due to recent inflationary pressures. Medicare Part B trends have been aligned with Medicare  trends based on the SOA Getzen model. These rates are applied to health costs and premiums. Long -Term Expected Rate of Return The long -term expected rate of return on OPEB retiree plan investments was determined using  a building -block method in which best estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return  (expected returns, net of investment expense and inflation) are developed for each major asset  class. These ranges are combined to produce the long -term expected rate of return by weighting  the expected future real rates of return by the target asset allocation percentage and by adding  expected inflation. Best estimates of a rithmetic real rates of return for each major class included in the target asset allocation as of December 31, 202 3are summarized as follows: Rate of Return For the year ended December 31, 2023, the annual money -weighted rate of return on  investments, net of investment expense, was 2.55%. The money -weighted rate of return  expresses investment performance, net of investment expense, adjusted for the changing  amounts actually invested.  Discount Rate The final equivalent single discount rate used to measure the total OPEB retiree plan liability was  7.00% for 2023withthe expectation that the City will continue to fund the full pay-go costs in Long-term  expected Target Allocation Real Rate o f Retu rn Asset Cla ss Equity 55.00% 8.2% Fixed income 32.00% 3.2% Cash 3.00% 1.7% Real  Assets 5.00% 6.5% Alterna tive Stra tegies 5.00% 6.3% 100.00% CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 88the future.

Description of 2017 C Swaps During fiscal year 2017, the PWSA restructured three pay-fixed, receive -variable interest rate  swap contracts. The original interest rate swaps were effective June 12, 2008. Beginning December 28, 2017, the PWSA will make semi -annual interest payments on the 1stof each March  and September through September 1, 2039 (two swaps); and September 1, 2040 (for one swap),  respectively. The Counterparties make monthly interest payments on the 1stof each calendar  month, which begin February 2018 through September 1, 2039 for two of the swaps ; and  September 1, 2040 for one swap. The intention of the 2017 swaps restructuring is to effectively change the PWSA’s variable  interest rate on the $216,720,000 ,Water and Sewer System First Lien Revenue Refunding Bonds  Series C of 2017 with notional amounts of $71,225,000, $72,747,500, and $72,747,500 to fixed  rates of 3.8255%, 3.770%, and 3. 7835%, respectively.  The bonds will accrue interest at a weekly rate that is determined by a remarketing agent on each  effective rate date. The interest rate on the bonds may not exceed 12%. Per the interest rate  swap agreements, the PWSA will receive 70% of one -month LIBOR. The interest payments on the interest rate swaps are calculated based on notional amounts, all  of which reduce beginning on September 2032, so that the notional amounts approximate the  CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 115principal outstanding on the respective bonds. The interest rate swaps expire consistent with the  final maturity of the respective bonds.  On November 12, 2020, the PWSA entered into a new swap transaction (the “Overlay Swap”) associated with the 2017 Series C variable rate bonds (the “Bonds” orthe “2017C Bonds”). The  Overlay Swap’s purpose was to convert the cash flows of the PWSA’s outstanding fixed payer  swap portfolio from 70% one-month LIBOR to the Weekly SIFMA Index (plus a third payment leg  that includes a fixed rate component of the PWSA paying 0.118%) between the Overlay Swap’s effective date of December 1, 2020 and termination date of December 1, 2023. The notional  amount of the Overlay Swap is $216,720,000 matching 100% of the aggregate notional amount  of the PWSA’s outstanding fixed payer swap portfolio. The Overlay Swap was entered into an  alignment with the PWSA’s successful remarketing of the Bonds on December 1, 2020 from a  70% one -month LIBOR mode into a Weekly SIFMA Index mode. During 2023, one of the pay fixed, receive variable interest rate swaps and the overlay swap were  terminated as part of the issuance of the Series 2023 B Bonds. Accounting and Risk Disclosures During the year ended December 31, 2023, the PWSA paid $6,263 ,000 fixed and received  $5,273 ,000 variable related to their outstanding swap agreements. As noted in the tables above, current period changes in fair value for the interest rate sw aps that  are accounted for as hedges are recorded on the statements of net position as an adjustment to  hedging derivative –interest rate swap, deferred outflows or deferred inflows. Additionally,  current period changes in fair value for the interest rate swap accounted for as an investment is  recorded on the statements of revenues, expenses, and changes in net position as a co mponent  of investment income. The fair value of the outstanding interest rate swaps as of December 31,   2023is reported on the statements of net position as a swap asset and swap liability. The swaps  are valued using significant other observable inputs (Level 2 inputs). The PWSA has the ability to early terminate the interest rate swaps and to cash settle the  transaction on any business day by providing at least two business days’ written notice to the  counterparty . Evidence that the PWSA has sufficient funds available to pay any amount payable  to the counterparty must be provided at the time notice is given. At early termination, the PWSA  will be required to pay or receive a settlement amount which is comprised of the fair value of the  terminated transaction(s) based on market quotations and any amounts accrued under the  contract(s). CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 116Through the use of derivative instruments such as interest rate swa ps, the PWSA is exposed to a  variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, termination risk, basis risk, and rollover  risk. Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not fulfill its obligations. The credit ratings   by S&P Global Ratings, a nationally recognized statistical rating organization for the  respective counterparties are listed in the table above. If a counterparty failed to perform  according to the terms of the interest rate swap agreement, there is some risk of loss to  the PWSA, up to the fair value of the swaps. The PWSA currently does not enter into master netting arrangements with its counterparties. As  such, each derivative instrument should be evaluated on an individual basis for credit risk. As of  December 31, 202 3, the Series 2017 C receivable variable, pay fixed derivative instruments were  subject to credit risk, as they had a positive fair value. Concentration of credit risk: The PWSA’s outstanding market value as of December 31, 2023is  $12,896 ,000 with one counterparty and couldbeimpacted by changes in economic or other  conditions. It is the PWSA’s policy to require counterparty collateral posting provisions in its non-exchange  traded derivative instru ments. Their terms require collateral to be posted if the respective  counterparty’s credit rating falls below BBB-by S&P Global Ratings and the swap insurer becomes  bankrupt. The amount of collateral to be posted is calculated based on derivatives in asset  positions to the PWSA. As of year -end, the counterparties had not and were not required to post  collateral for these transactions. Termination risk is the risk that a derivative’s unscheduled end will affect the PWSA’s  asset/liability strategy or will present the PWSA with potentially significant  unscheduled termination payments to the counterparty. The counterparties to the  interest rate swaps do not have the ability to voluntarily terminate the interest rate  swap; however, the PWSA is exposed to termination risk in the event that one or more  of the counterparties defaults. The PWSA has the ability to voluntarily terminate the  swaps with prior written consent of the insurer by provi ding between 2 and 20  business days notice to the counterparty. The PWSA must demonstrate the ability to  pay all amounts due to the counterparty on the termination date. During 2023, one  of the pay fixed, receive variable interest rate swaps and the overlay swap were  terminated as part of the issuance of the Series 2023 B Bonds. CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 117Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will adversely affect the fair  values of a government’s financial instruments or cash flows.  The interest rate swap sare highly sensitive to changes in interest rates; changes in the variable rate will have a  material effect on the swap’s fair value.   The PWSA is further subject to basis risk in the event that the underlying bonds become  fixed rate Bank Bonds or that the maturity of the underlying bonds is accelerated. Rollover risk is the risk that a derivative associated with the PWSA’s debt does not extend  to the maturity of th atdebt. When the derivative terminates, the associated debt will no  longer have the benefit of the derivative. The PWSA is not exposed to rollover risk as the  swap agreements terminate on the same day the last payment is due on the respective  Contingencies All of the PWSA’s derivative instruments include provisions that require the PWSA to post  collateral in the event that the credit ratings of its credit support provider’s senior long term,  unsecured debt credit rating falls below BBB-by S&P Global Ratings and FSA, the swap insurer,  becomes bankrupt. The collateral is to be posted in the form of cash, U.S. Treasuries or other  approved securities. As of year -end, the PWSA was not required to post collateral for these  transactions.

Related Party Transactions (A)Under the terms of agreements dated July 1, 1965 and amended on various dates through  June 17, 1992, the City of Pittsburgh made total grants of $22,775,168 to the Stadium  Authority to cover the excess of the aggregate cost of operation and maintenance of the  stadium and debt service on the stadium bonds over the total funds available to the  Stadium Authority for those purposes, to be repaid if funds are available . The Stadium  Authority has this reflected as a long -term note due to the City.  However, the C ity does  not have a corresponding receivable recorded due to the unlikelihood of collection. (B)On January 1, 2015, the City and the Parking Authority entered into the 2015  Governmental Cooperation Agreement (Agreement). In September 2021, the Agreement  was amended a second time (Second Amended Agreement ). Under the terms of the  Second Amended Agreement, the Parking Authority willreceive the first $5.6 million of  on-street meter revenue, as well as the operating expenses associated with the o n-street  CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 127multi -space parking meters including credit card fees. The City will receive 100% of the  net revenues of the Pittsburgh Parking Court (net of all expenses).  Under the terms ofthe Second Amended Agreement, payment in lieu of taxes payable by the  Parking Authority will be abated entirely for ten calendar years, beginning with the 2021 calendar  year. Payment in lieu of taxes will be reinstated in full in calendar year 2031. Before the Second  Amended Agreement, the payment in lieu of taxes payable by the Parking Authority had  previously been $1.9 million. The City and the Parking Authority have also agreed, in the event that total amounts of all  payments from the Parking Authority to the City (excluding parking tax payments), exceeds $18.5  million with respect to any fiscal year of the Parking Authority, any such excess amounts will be  split equally by the City and the Parking Authority. The City’s share of the excess was $0 for the  year ended December 31, 2023.These terms were not modified by the Second Amended  Agreement. (C)During 2018, the City, HACP (a related entity) ,and the URA (a component unit) agreed to  enter into a joint ownership of a new facility. As part of this joint transaction, the City issued $40  million in notes to fund the purchase and renovation of a building for HACP, the URA, and City  departments locatedin the Civic Building. HACP and the URA have each entered into a legally  binding agreement with the City to fund their portion of the debt related to the building purchase  and renovations. As of Decemb er 31, 2023, the outstanding amount due from the URA of $7.9 million for related proceeds drawn are reflected in the financial statements. The repayment  schedules for the amounts receivable coincide with the City’s debt payment schedule; however,  HACP accelerated their payments and repaid their total balance during 2022. The new building  was purchased during 2018 for approximately $27.5 million and renovation swill be ongoing  through 202 4. The URA’s portion of the debt related to the build out approximated $2.6 million,  which is included in the outstanding amount due from the URA.  (D) In December 2017, the City committed $10 million per year for 12 years to source a Housing  Opportunity Fund (HOF). The Mayor appointed a 17-person Advisory Board to administer the  fund in June 2018 and entered into a cooperation agreement with the URA to hold and manage  the fund. The URA’s Housing Opportunity Fund Department staffs this initiative. The HOF staff  and Advisory Board creates an annual allocation plan and monitors programs and program  guidelines. The new HOF programs established are: Down Payment and Closing Cost Assista nce (DPCCAP) provides financing to first-time  homebuyers in the City to help make the purchase of a home affordable. This program is  designed to help stimulate housing investment in the City by providing financial assistance  CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 128to potential homebuyers for the purpose of purchasing an existing or newly constructed  residential unit. Homeowner Assistance Program (HAP) provides financial and technical assistance to  eligible homeowners for rehabilitating and improving residential owner -occupied  properties citywide. Rental Gap Program (RGP) will be used to help fund the creation of new affordable  housing and/or preserve existing affordable housing in the City. The HOF RGP provides  loans to developers for the creation and/or preservation of affordable units. Housing Stabilization Program (HSP) provides one-time or short -term (no more than 12  months) funding to help with emergency housing expenses such as rent and utilities. It is  designed to assist participants to stabilize their current housing, or facilitate access to  appropriate housing, and prevent homelessness. The program will also allow for legal  eviction prevention services, including legal consultation and representation for eviction  defense and/or related supportive services.  For-Sale Development Program (FSDP) provides construction financing to developers with  non-profit applicants for the substantial rehabilitation or new construction of for-sale  housing. The Legal Assistance Program (LAP) provides a variety of free housing legal services to  eligible tenants and homeowners who live in the City.  The Small Landlord Fund (SLF) provides funding to landlords with ten (10) or fewer units  for the preservation of existing affordable rental housing and/or the conversion of  market/vacant housing to affordable housing in the City. (E) As described in Note 9, during 2023, the URA issued 2023 Revenue Bonds , Taxable, and  entered into a cooperation agreement with the City.   The bonds were issued to finance various   affordable housing programs including of the URA’s Rental Gap Program, For -Sale Development  Program, Pittsburgh Downtown Conversion Program, Housing Preservation Program, other URA  programs related to construction or rehabilitation of affordable housing in the City, and financing  costs of issuing the bonds.  The City has agreed to provide an amount not to exceed $2,500,000  annually for up to 25 years (through 2047) to assist in the repayment of principal and interest on  these bonds, with such payments subject to annual appropriation by City Council.

Regional Asset District Revenues In December 1993, the Commonwealth legisl ature approved Act 77 of 1993 authorizing the  creation of RAD by Allegheny County. RAD is a special purpose district whose primary purpose is  to provide support and financing for regional community assets that were historically funded by  the City, Allegheny Count y, or local municipalities. The City does not include RAD within its  reporting entity since the City is not financially accountable for RAD’s operations. These  community assets include regional parks of the City and Allegheny County, municipal libraries,  the Pittsburgh Zoo, the National Aviary, Phipps Conservatory, the old Three Rivers Stadium debt,  PNC Park, Acrisure Stadium , and community cultural facilities. RAD revenue allocated to the City totaled approximately $38.2 million in 2023. The City allocated  approximately $1. 6million to park operations. Contingencies The City has been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of  its operations against which the City is not insured. In the opinion of the City Solicitor, adequate  accrual has been made in the financial statements for such lawsuits.   In addition, there is on- going litigation regarding the allowability of the City’s Facility Usage Tax (FUF) .  The lower courts  did not rule in favor of the City’s FUF tax. The City has appealed to the Pennsylvania Supreme  Court.  The petition for appeal is still pending as of the date of this report.  The City has  determine da reasonable estimate of refunds is not determinable as of December 31, 2023.   During 2023 several large properties appealed their real estate assessments and won reduction s in their assessed value sand several more were awarded reductions from their appeals   subsequent to year -end that relate to 2023 and prior years .  In addition, there are currently a  CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 131number of real estate appeals in process for which the outcome and possible further reduction  in the real estate tax levy cannot be determined at thistime. The City has accrued an estimate  fortax refunds of $6 million within accounts payable on the statement of net position and  governmental funds (general) balance sheet. The City receive s federal and state grants under a number of programs. The expenditures of the  City under such programs are subject to audit and possible disallowance. Historically, such audits  have not resulted in significant disallowances of program costs, and City mana gement believe s that audits of existing programs will not result in significant liability to the City. Any contingent  liability accrual deemed appropriate has been reflected in the financial statements as presented. Component Units : Attorney General Criminal Complaint –PWSA In June 2016, the Authority exceeded the drinking water lead action level established under the  Pennsylvania Safe Drinking Water Act. As the Authority attempted to meet federal Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) and Pennsylvania Department of Environmen tal Protection (DEP)  service line replacement requirements, the Authority violated the Safe Water Drinking Act in  2016 and 2017 by failing to provide 45-day advanced notice of partial service lead line  replacement to customers at some homes and failing to provide post -construction test kits. In  November 2017, the Authority entered into a consent order agreement with DEP related to these  violations that included a civil penalty of $2.4 million. The portion of the Attorney General  misdemeanor counts described in the subsequent paragraph that relate to partial lead line  replacements and lack of customer notices are duplicative to the violations that resulted in the  aforementioned consent order agreement with the DEP. On April 17, 2019, the Pennsylvania Office of the Attorney General completed a filing in the  Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas, Docket CP-02-CR-0002636 -2019, alleging 161 third - degree misdemeanor counts under the Pennsylvania Safe Drinking Water Act, which were later  reduced to 152 counts. The misdemeanors addressed the Authority’s violations relating to the  Authority’s unauthorized changes to its corrosion control treatment and its public water system  by substituting corrosion control treatment chemi cals without first obtaining the appropriate  permit from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. Also, the Authority  performed partial lead service line replacements, which can result in an increase in lead  contamination for the residence , without providing its customers with the advance notice and  follow -up sampling required under the state and federal safe drinking water regulations. CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 132A Pre-Disposition Remediation Resolution (PDRR) dated July 15, 2020 was developed between  the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania Attorney General's (AG) Office, and the  PWSA related to unauthorized changes in corrosion control treatment and partial lead service  line replacements under prior management and dating back to 2014. The PDRR required the  PWSA issue a public statement, make charitable donations totaling $500,000, and enter into a  two-year Corporate Monitorship. The Corporate Monitor hasbeen overseeing water treatment  plant operations, corrosion control treatment and lead service line replacement efforts, and  providing quarterly reports to the AG and the Southwest PADEP office, with their final report  issued in the first quarter of 2023. On March 22, 2023, the AG’s office submitted to the court that  PWSA has satisfied the requirements under the PDRR. The Judge accepted the submission from  the AG’s office and on March 30, 2023 granted the AG’s motion to withdraw charges based on  PWSA’s com pliance with the Pre -Disposition Remediation Resolution.  Lead Mitigation –PWSA The PWSA continued its critical initiatives to comply with the Consent Order and Agreement, and  other requirements mandated by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection  (PADEP) and the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission (PUC). These initiatives include: (1) a  water treatment program to mitigate lead corrosion so as to comply with current water quality  standards, (2) a lead service line replacement program, and (3) a lead service line identification  program to be completed by 2020 for residential service line connections and a 2022 update to  include all service line connections. These requirements are stipulated in the PADEP Consent  Order and Agreement with the PWSA dated November 2017. Water Treatment: Chemical treatment testing of orthophosphate application to the PWSA’s  finished water demonstrated rapid mitigation of lead and copper corrosion to levels well below  any current federal drinking water standard. The PWSA fully implemented the introduction of  orthophosphate to the drinking water system in April 2019, and since then has had two  consecutive 6-month rounds of lead monitoring results below Federal action level of 15.0 parts  per billion (ppb), along with three additional rounds oflead monitoring also below 15.0 ppb.  [Action levels are the EPA’s established standard for water system compliance with the Federal  Lead and Copper Rule.] The results were 10.0 ppb in the monitoring that ended in December  2019, 5.1 ppb for the monitoring that ended in June 2020, 7.1 ppb for the monitoring that ended  in December 2021, 4.42 ppb for the monitoring that ended June 2022 ,5.0 for the monitoring that  ended December 2022 , 3.4 ppb for the monitoring that ended June 2023, and 3.58 for the  monitoring that ended December 2023 . The second round of results below the action level  removed the mandated requirement to replace lead service lines. CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 133Lead Service Line Replacement: The Authority was ordered by PADEP to replace 1,341 public  owned lead service lines by June 30, 2018 and an additional 7 percent of the public owned lead  service lines by December 31, 2018 (a total of about 2,200). By the end of 2018 a total of 2,765  publi c lead service lines had been replaced. In addition, the Authority was required to continue  to replace 7 percent of the initial number of lead service lines in the system (revised to 855 based  upon Authority data) until two consecutive 6-month monitoring period sampling events were   below the Federal lead action level (where this replacement requirement ended in June 2020 as   described above). As of the date of this report, over 10,900 public, along with over 7,675 private  lead service lines have been replaced. In October 2020, the Authority completed work on the 2019 Neighborhood LSLR project with  $49.1 million in funding through PENNVEST, of which $35.4 million was a loan and $13.7 million  was a grant.  This program replaced over 4,738 public and 3,008 private lead service lines (as of  March 18, 2022), well above the anticipated amounts of 3,400 public and 2,800 private  replacements.  In June 2020, the Authority transitioned into the next phase of the LSLR program by replacing  lead service lines in concert with a water main replacement program. In this manner, the  Authority minimizes the overall cost for water main and service line replacements. Most of the  remaining lead service lines are connected to the oldest water mains in the system, most subjec t  to breakage and failure. The Authority will strive to implement this program at the lowest  possible cost to the Authority, while addre ssing those water mains that have the highest  likelihood of failure. The Authority’s investment in water main replacement will continue  unabated to ensure that the Authority can mitigate the amount of annual pipe breaks and  minimize the risk of service disruption to its customers. The Authority’s program intends to  achieve an average water main life expectancy more in line with national standards.  In 2022, with the availability of outside funding sources, the Authority commenced additional  LSLR projects. The first was funded by PENNVEST and focused on removing lead service lines at  day care facilities and locations with elevated levels of lead in the drinking water. The 2022  Priority LSLR program was extremely successful and all LSLR work was completed by late 2022.  The 2022 Neighborhood LSLR program was funded by American Recovery Plan Act funds, and  construction of the $17.5M program commenced in April 2022. The Authority is currently  completing the last of the work under the 2022 Neighborhood LSLR including service line  identification and LSLR at over 2,600 properties. Finally, with funding being provided for LSLRs by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act,  PWSA is planning to submit additional funding requests to PENNVEST for continued  Neighborhood LSLR programs on a semi -annual basis. To date, three projects have b een funded:  CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 134a $13.4M project that commenced in July 2023, a $12.2M project starting in March 2024 and a  $32M project starting in August 2024. Another application for continued PENNVEST funding is  planned for May 2024. In summary, as of March 13, 2023, the Authority has replaced a total of more than 10,900 public   and 7,675 private lead service lines under all programs involving the removal of lead service lines,  including the Lead Service Line Replacement Program (2016 through 2023 Contracts) and Small  Diameter Water Main Replacement Program. Small Diameter Water Main Replacement Program:   The ongoing Small Diameter Water Main  Replacement (SDWMR) Program consists of a series of annual projects designed to replace aging  and undersized water mains in neighborhoods with a high likelihood of having lead service lines.   The 2020 SDWMR projects consisted of three individual construction contracts totaling nearly 15  miles of new water main.  These projects were designed in 2019, construction started in mid- 2020 and were completed in December 2021 and, inclusive of design and construction, cost  approximately $56 million.   The second phase of SDWMR projects (2021 SDWMR) was funded by PENNVEST.  Designs for  three 2021 SDWMR Projects (Contracts A / B / C) started in August 2020 and were complete  February 2021.  Based on the Opinion of Probable Construction Costs (OPCC) for the3 Contracts,  a decision was made to move two of the three 2021 contracts (B / C) forward to bidding in March  2021.  Due to a delay with closing the PENNVEST funding, Contracts B and C were cancelled, and  rebids were received in December 2021.  Constructio n of the 2021B and 2021C SDWMR Projects  began in late March 2022 and reached substantial completion in September 2023.  Nearly 6 miles  of pipeline replacement including associated valving, fittings and hydrants were completed in six  neighborhoods across the Authority service area, including the concurrent replacement of 929  public -side service lines (589 copper and 340 lead) and 293 lead private -side service lines.   Construction cost for 2021B and 2021C was approximately $27 million.  The design for 2021C  SDWMR was renamed 2022C SDWMR and bid at the same time as 2022A and 2022B SDWMR  Contracts (see below). The third phase of SDWMR projects (2022 SDWMR) was funded by PENNVEST.  Designs for the  2022A and 2022B SDWMR projects were started August 2021 and were completed October 2022.   Resolution of clean fill disposal requirements delayed bidding until March 2023.  Construction  bids were received for the 2022 SDWMR projects in May 2023, greatly exceeding the construction  cost estimates, only allowing for two (2022B and 2022C) of the three construction contracts to  proceed construction on time in late-Summer/early -Fall of 2023.  Construction of Contracts  2022B and 2022C continues in 2024.  Total construction value for these projects is $60.1M as of  March 2024, which includes addressing 7.6 miles of the more than 9 miles of water mains  CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 135planned and replacement of over 515 of the 1,250 water service lines planned as of March 2024.   Rebidding of the delayed 2022A Contract (divided into 2 Contracts, A1 and A2) was initiated in  March of 2024, and anticipated to be awarded in May 2024.  The fourth phase of SDWMR projects (2023 SDWMR) was funded by PENNVEST. Design of the  2023A1/A2/B1/B2 SDWMR Projects began in April 2023.  Bidding for construction of these four  separate SDWMR projects that address eight neighborhoods is expected to occur in stages during  the second to third quarter of 2024.  These projects will construct approximately 19.5 miles of  new water mains and will replace nearly 2,800 public -side service lines and 1,650 lead private - side service lines. The estimated cost of this work will be nearly $93M. The 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027, and 2028 contracts are currently in the 2024 Capital Improvement  Plan with a total cumulative value of $586.5 million, which equates to approximately 78 miles of  small diameter water main to be replaced. Lead Service Line Identification Program: The lead service line identification program determines  the materials of manufacture for each existing water service line in the Authority’s system. The  first phase of that program was completed with the digitization of existing records. The second  phas e, which has evolved since the signing of the consent order, consists of a combination of  verification inspections and replacement records of ongoing infrastructure programs, video  inspection of accessible residenti al service lines to evaluate the materials of manufacture,  identification of private service lines while replacing meters, the development of a machine - learning predictive model in conjunction with the University of Pittsburgh and further records - mining with the Authority, City of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County Plumbing Department. This  phase was completed in December 2020 and submitted to the PADEP, in compliance with the  Consent Order and Agreement. The third phase includes identifying service line mate rials for non- residential customers and providing an update for all locations. This effort was submitted to  PADEP in December 2022. The Identification Program will culminate in a complete digital file and mapping of all service lines  within the Authority’s service territory. All updated records are made publicly available on the  Authority’s website within one month of the data being co llected. The Environmental Protection Agency’s (“EPA”) Lead and Copper Rule Revisions (LCRR) mandates  all utilities submit an updated service line inventory by October 2024. In conjunction with this  requirement, the PADEP provided new requirements for acceptable inventory methods late  2022. The Authority is presently updating our inventory based on the new PADEP requirements,  including having a new machine learning predictive model prepared and instituting a large -scale  program to identify service line materials ins ide customer’s homes. CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 136Environmental Protection Agency –PWSA The Authority has been cooperating with the EPA’s investigation of the Authority’s Aspinwall  Water Treatment Plant (“Water Treatment Plant”) for nearly three years.

On January 15, 2021,  pursuant to a plea agreement, the Court entered the Authority’s plea of guilty to two counts of  violations of the Clean Water Act.  The terms of the settlement are contained in a plea letter  dated December 30, 2020 and executed by the Authority on January 13, 2021.  Sentencing   occurred on September 14, 2021 and included seven standard conditions of supervision and  reference to the requirements established in the Plea Agreement. A U.S. Probation Officer has  been assigned to PWSA and the Authority is required to provide monthly updates to the  probation officer.  EPA’s Suspension and Debarment Division placed the Authority on its Suspension and Debarment  list upon the Authority’s guilty plea on September 14, 2021. EPA and the Authority entered into  an Administrative Agreement, which allowed the Authority to be prom ptly removed from the list  on the same day.  A Pre-Disposition Remediation Resolution (PDRR) dated July 15, 2020 was developed between  the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania Attorney General's (AG) Office and the  Authority related to unauthorized changes in corrosion control treatment and partial lead service  line replacements under prior management and dating back to 2014. The PDRR required the  Authority to issue a public statement, make charitable donations totaling $500,000, and enter  into a two-year Corporate Monitorship. The Corporate Monitor has been overseeing water  treatment plant operations, corrosion control treatment and lead service line replacement  efforts and providing quarterly reports to the AG and the Southwest PADEP office, with their final  report issued in the first quart er of 2023. On March 22, 2023 the AG’s office submitted to the  court that the Authority has satisfied the requirements under the PDRR. The Judge accepted the  submission from the AG’s office and on March 30, 2023 granted the AG’s motion to withdraw  charges based on PWSA’s compliance with the Pre -Disposition Remediation Resolution. Consent Order –PWSA The PWSA is subject to federal regulation under the Clean Water Act (1977) and regulations   adopted under that Act. Among the specific requirements applicable to the PWSA’s system are  those imposed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s Comb ined Sewe r  Overflow (CSO) Policy (1994). On January 29, 2004, the PWSA and the City executed a Consent  Order and Agreement (Order) regarding wet weather sewer overflows within the City. The other  CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 137signat ories to the Order are the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and  the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD). Generally, the Order requires the PWSA and the City to assess the City sewers to develop a plan  with ALCOSAN to address wet weather sewer overflows within the City. The Order is part ofa  sewer assessment program for all municipalities served by ALCOSAN. To date ,assessment  activities have been completed for all accessible critical sewers and separate sanitary sewers with  the exception of any additional sewers discovered through continued research and investigation.  Critical sewers were defined in the Order as: trunk sewers that are a final conveyance to the  ALCOSAN Sewer System, sewers associated with areas of chronic basement flooding, sewers  associated with areas of chroni cmaintenance, sewer sassociated with chronic surcharge, sewers  downstr eam of diversion structures, sewers where additional information is necessary for model  development, and sewers deemed a priority for inspection by a professional engineer. Ongoing pipe and manhole repairs are being completed to provide CCTV access to remaining inaccessible  critical/sanitary sewer pipes. Assessment activities for non-critical sewers are to be completed  on a longer schedule. Th e majority of accessible non -critical manholes have been inspected with  ongoing efforts to complete any remaining or newly identified accessible non -critical manholes.  The required Wet Weather Feasibility Study (WWFS) was submitted to the DEP and ACHD on  time in July of 2013. This long -term control plan outlined system -wide improvements, including  Green Infrastructure (GI) that PWSA would implement over the next 20 years.  As this Order with the DEP expired in March 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  (USEPA) became the main regulatory body to which the PWSA is responsible. On January 21,  2016, the USEPA issued a Clean Water Act Section 308 Information Request to the PWSA. The  USEPA 308 request required the PWSA to submit detailed information on past Order  performance and activities. It also required the PWSA to conduct a source reduction analysis for  the entire service area, followed by GI demonstration projects. PWSA hired two engineering firms to assess and model the sewer system, responding to the first  phase of the USEPA 308 request by the due date March 31, 2016. The second phase of the  request was responded to by the submission of a source reduction study by the due date of  December 1, 2016 and the submission of project performance evaluations for certain  construction GI demonstration projects by the due date of December 1, 2017. An additional 308  request from the USEPA was received in October 2016 seeking more detailed information and  further actions regarding the assessment of the PWSA’s sewer system. The response to the  October 2016 request from the USEPA was delivered in January 2017. CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 138In addition to the assessment, the USEPA 308 request also requires the PWSA and the City to  continue implementing the Nine Minimum Controls to reduce combined sewer overflows, and  to perform repairs and maintenance of deficiencies revealed by the assessment. The PWSA   maintains an expedited response to significant structural failures of the sewer system where  imminent structural failures are determined by a professional engineer and prioritized for repair.  Ongoing sewer line replacement, point repair, and trenchless rehabilitation projects have been  implemented to address structural deficiencies. The USEPA 308 request also requires the  submission of information on an ongoing, rolling basis, updating the progress of the evaluations   and improvements, as well as water quality impacts. These reports are submitted monthly.  Given the broad scope of a potential CD, th esize of the sewer system in the City, and the various  conditions and/or deficiencies that may be discovered by the assessment, it is difficult to predict  the total cost of compliance with the CD. Moreover, it is difficult to predict what, if any, largescale  and/or regional capital improvements may be required after the completion of the assessment to address wet weather sewer overflows in the City and in the ALCOSAN service area. Costs  associated with CD and COA compliance will be reflected in the capital improvement program  and funded by proceeds of potential future bond issuances.  Arena Land Agreement –URA On September 11, 2014, the URA entered into a Comprehensive Option Agreement (the  “Agreement”) with the Sports & Exhibition Authority of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County (the  “SEA”) and Pittsburgh Arena Real Estate Redevelopment LP (the “Redeveloper”) that replaced  previous agreements regarding the redevelopment of t he approximately 28 -acre site comprised  of the former Civic Arena and surrounding parking lots. Approximately 9 acres of the site are  owned by the URA. On June 20, 2018, the parties to the Agreement executed an amended and  restated Option Agreement which amends and replaces the Agreement. Pursuant to the  “Amended Agreement”, the URA and the SEA have certain joint development Obligations. If  those obligations are not met, the URA and SEA have a maximum joint liability of $6,000,000. Risk Management and Uncertainties The City is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damage to, and destruction  of assets; errors and omissions; and natural disasters. The risk of loss to which the City is exposed  for the above -mentioned items is handled through vario us insurance coverages. As of December  31, 2023, there wereno settlements exceeding coverage for the past three years. The City also  covers certain claim settlements and judgements from its General and Capital Projects Fund resources due to the prohibiti ve cost of carrying certain commercial insurance. The City currently  CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 202 3 139reports all risk management activities out of its General Fund. Claims liabilities are reported when  it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of that loss can be reasonably estimated.   These losses include an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet report ed.  Provisions are recorded within current liabilities for amounts payable within one year. Amounts  not payable within one year are reported within long -term liabilities.  Changes in the accrued claims and judgements liability for the past two fiscal periods (calendar  year 202 3and 202 2) are as follows: 2023 2022 Accrued claims and judgments, January 1 21,406,000$  14,758,000$   Current year claims 4,849,401       8,378,626        Claim payments/Reduction in estimate (5,762,197)      (1,730,626)        Accrued claims and judgments, December 31 20,493,204$  21,406,000$   These accruals are subject to potential losses in excess of the amount recorded at year -end; it is  unlikely that the amount for such potential losses would be material. Also, the City is fully self-insured for workers’ compensation benefits. The City monitors its  liability through periodic actuarial studies. A self-insurance reserve fund in the amount of  $348,605 (classified as restricted within the General Fund) is maintained, due to a legal  requirement under self -insurance regulations of the State of Pennsylvania, in the General Fund. Changes in the accrued workers’ compensation liability during the year ended December 31,  2023are as follows: Accrued worker's compensation, January 1 88,541,140 $          Current year claims 17,249,178             Claim payments (16,888,682)               Accrued worker's compensation, December 31 88,901,636 $          The City is self-insured for losses and liabilities related to health insurance claims. Losses are  accrued based upon the City’s estimate of the aggregate liability for claims incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and based on the City’s experience.  Specific and aggregate stop -loss insurance policies limit the City’s exposure to large claims.  Incurred but not reported costs are estimated to be $3. 2million at December 31, 202 3.

Additionally, separate actuarial valuations are performed  annually for each plan.  However, the individual plans do not record the undivided  interest in the investments in their individual plans since the assets of the  Comprehensive Trus t are available for the payment of benefits and expenses of any of  the three pension plans without limitations. Therefore, in accordance with  Governmental Accounting Standards, the City is considered to be administering a single  plan for financial reporting purposes.  The three pension plans plus the Comprehensive  Trust constitute the City's Pension Plan.
