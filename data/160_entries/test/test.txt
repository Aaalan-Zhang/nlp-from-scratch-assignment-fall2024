One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of theOhio Country. In 1784, Thomas Vickroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, thePittsburgh Post-Gazettewas started, and in 1787, thePittsburgh Academywas chartered. Unrest during theWhiskey Rebellionof 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400.

By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of theAllegheny Mountains. TheGreat Fire of Pittsburghdestroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape theGreat Famine. By 1857, Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22\xa0million coal bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area, with the most coming fromGermany.", "Because Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution, enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city. There were active stations of theUnderground Railroadin the city, and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and African-American workers in city hotels. The Drennen Slave Girl walked out of the Monongahela House in 1850, apparently to freedom.[40]The Merchant's Hotel was also a place where African-American workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the Underground Railroad.[41]Sometimes refugee slaves from the South stayed in Pittsburgh, but other times they continued North, including into Canada. Many slaves left the city and county for Canada after Congress passed the 1850Fugitive Slave Act, as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties.

There were massive layoffs from mill and plant closures.[11]', "In the later 20th century, the area shifted its economic base to education, tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine, finance, and high technology such as robotics. Although Pittsburgh successfully shifted its economy and remained viable, the city's population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. While 680,000 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence resulted in a decrease in city population, even as the metropolitan area population increased again.", 'During thelate 2000s recession, Pittsburgh was economically strong, adding jobs when most cities were losing them.

In 2019, outside of California, Allegheny County was the only county in the United States that recorded failing grades for all three.[87]', "In a 2013 ranking of 277 metropolitan areas in the United States, theAmerican Lung Associationranked only six U.S. metro areas as having higher amounts of short-term particle pollution, and only seven U.S. metro areas having higher amounts of year-round particle pollution than Pittsburgh. For ozone (smog) pollution, Pittsburgh was ranked 24th among U.S. metro areas.[88][89]The area has improved its air quality with every annual survey. The ALA's rankings have been disputed by the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD), since data from only the worst of the region's 20 air quality monitors is considered by the ALA, without any context or averaging. The lone monitor used is immediately downwind and adjacent to U.S. Steel'sClairton Coke Works, the nation's largestcokemill, and several municipalities outside the city's jurisdiction of pollution controls, leading to possible confusion that Pittsburgh is the source or center of the emissions cited in the survey.[90]The region's readings also reflect pollution swept in from Ohio and West Virginia.[91]", 'Although the county was still below the "pass" threshold, the report showed substantial improvement over previous decades on every air quality measure. Fewer than 15 high ozone days were reported between 2007 and 2009, and just 10 between 2008 and 2010, compared to more than 40 between 1997 and 1999.[92]ACHD spokesman Guillermo Cole stated "It\'s the best it\'s been in the lifetime for virtually every resident in this county ...
