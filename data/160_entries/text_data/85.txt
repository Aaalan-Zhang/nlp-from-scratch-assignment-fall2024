Transportation in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States
Fort Pitt Bridge
with
Downtown Pittsburgh
in the background
A large metropolitan area that is surrounded by rivers and hills,
Pittsburgh
has an infrastructure system that has been built out over the years to include roads, tunnels, bridges, railroads, inclines, bike paths, and stairways; however, the hills and rivers still form many barriers to transportation within the city.
Roads and infrastructure
[
edit
]
The high number of freeze/thaw cycles during the winter is sometimes blamed for the difficulty of maintaining local roads.
Streets
[
edit
]
A 1795 map of
Pittsburgh
Pittsburgh
is home to several notable streets.
Roslyn Place
is a small wooden-paved
cul-de-sac
located in the
Shadyside
neighborhood of
Pittsburgh
,
Pennsylvania
. The street was built in 1914 in the
Nicolson Pavement
style and is home to the historic
Roslyn Place district
.
Canton Avenue
is the steepest officially recorded public street in the
United States
.
[

]
[

]
[

]
East Carson Street
has one of the largest concentrations of 19th-century homes, which has prompted outsiders to call the neighborhood the City's
Georgetown
.
[
4
]
It includes many bars and restaurants as well as residences.
Grant Street
is the main government and business corridor in
Pittsburgh
,
Pennsylvania
. It is home to the global headquarters of
U.S. Steel
,
Koppers Chemicals
,
Federated Investors
, and
Oxford Development
. It also is home to the seat of
Allegheny County
, City of Pittsburgh and the regional Federal Government offices. It is part of the
Pittsburgh Central Downtown Historic District
.
Expressways
[

Map showing major highways in Pittsburgh and its surrounding region
The main highway connecting Pittsburgh to the
Pennsylvania Turnpike
(
I-76
) on the east is
I-376
, known to locals as the "Parkway East." It includes the locally-notorious Squirrel Hill interchange, where unusual traffic patterns and the adjoining
tunnel
often cause traffic congestion. Several accidents have involved tall trucks getting stuck against the tunnel roof. Also part of I-376 is the "Parkway West," which leads from downtown Pittsburgh to the
Pittsburgh International Airport
's main terminal and leads into the contiguous Airport Parkway and Southern Expressway.
I-279
, known as the "Parkway North," runs north of the city to merge with
I-79
. It connects the city with the North Hills and the Cranberry area. There is no "Parkway South".
I-579
, or the "Crosstown Boulevard," is a spur off of I-279 that alleviates downtown and North Shore traffic headed north or south and to events at either the
convention center
or the
PPG Paints Arena
.
North of the city, the Parkway North and a short section of Interstate 579 over the
Veterans Bridge
have reversible
high occupancy vehicle
HOV lanes for rush-hour commuting, which require a minimum of two occupants per vehicle for use; no electric/hybrid vehicle "HOV OK" program has yet been made available. On August 25, 1995, six people were killed in a head-on collision on the HOV lanes after PennDOT employee William Dean Snyder failed to follow procedures.  Snyder maintained open the traffic gates for both directions simultaneously.

Belt system

Allegheny County Belt System
Main article:
Allegheny County Belt System
Unlike many other major U.S. cities, Pittsburgh lacks a dedicated contiguous beltway surrounding the city.
I-76
(
Pennsylvania Turnpike
),
I-79
, and
I-70
form a roughly triangular-shaped "beltway," but the distance of these roads from the city center and the need to exit and enter each leg in order to continue circling the city render them impractical as a beltway; commuters are forced to use secondary roads to go from suburb to suburb. The
Allegheny County Belt System
is an attempt at dealing with this without building additional infrastructure. The
Pittsburgh Wayfinder System
is a similar system that aims to guide travelers to popular destinations and services in the city proper.

List of tunnels in Pittsburgh
Pittsburgh is a city of bridges: over 2,000 bridges dot the landscape of Allegheny County. The southern entrance to Downtown is through the
Fort Pitt Tunnel
and then over the
Fort Pitt Bridge
.

Regional mass transit
[

Main article:
Pittsburgh Regional Transit
Local public transportation is coordinated by
Pittsburgh Regional Transit
, the 14th-largest urban
mass transit
system in the
United States
.  It services 730 square miles (1,900 km
2
), including all of
Allegheny County
and portions of
Armstrong
,
Beaver
,
Washington
, and
Westmoreland
counties.

PRT maintains a network of intracity
bus
routes, two
inclines
on Mt. Washington above Downtown (mostly a tourist attraction rather than a means of commuting), and a
light rail
/
busway
system. The transit agency discontinued its
commuter rail
system, the
PATrain
, in 1989, However, A New Line To
Arnold
Has Been Proposed Since 2009.
Pittsburgh Light Rail

Main articles:
Pittsburgh Light Rail
,

, and
Silver Line (Pittsburgh)
The light rail network is a direct descendant of the original
streetcar system
, which once numbered dozens of lines and included
interurban
routes to neighboring cities such as
Washington
and
Charleroi
. The current network comprises five routes on 25 miles (40 km) of track, operated by modern articulated
light rail vehicles
. Although most is on dedicated right-of-way, including the
Mt. Washington Transit Tunnel
, trains still
street run
in the Beechview neighborhood. Once across the
Monongahela River
trains enter a subway to serve
Downtown Pittsburgh
. Since March 2012, the
North Shore Connector
has extended service across the Allegheny River, via tunnel, to such destinations as
PNC Park
,
Heinz Field
, and
Rivers Casino
.

,
South Busway
,
Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway
, and
West Busway
PAT operates over 800 buses on both standard routes and
bus rapid transit
routes in Allegheny County. The latter use high-speed
articulated buses
that run at grade and above ground on their own right-of-way with platform stations, much like a rail system. In some instances, such as the Mount Washington tunnel, these buses travel along paved sections of the light rail line. There are currently three routes: the
South Busway
, from downtown to the southern part of Allegheny County, the
Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway
, from the
Amtrak station
to the eastern suburbs, and the
West Busway
, to the western suburbs. Future plans include extending the West Busway to the
Pittsburgh International Airport
.
All light rail/busway stations outside the downtown have PAT station shuttles that serve the surrounding neighborhoods, and sections of the metropolitan area not served by the light rail/busway system, including most of the northern suburbs, have regular PAT bus routes.  The mass transit systems of
Beaver
,
Fayette
,
Lawrence
,
Washington
, and
Westmoreland
counties (including
Mid Mon Valley Transit Authority
) operate their own commuter shuttles to and from the city; the private company Myers Coach Line operates commuter service from Butler County.

The mass transit system of
Monongalia County, West Virginia
also provides connections to Pittsburgh. In early 2005 the Southwestern Pennsylvania Commission proposed combining Pittsburgh Regional Transit, then known as Port Authority, with the nine surrounding metro counties transit agencies.

Trails
[

Unpaved portion of the
Three Rivers Heritage Trail
in Strip District
Pittsburgh has a thriving cycling community despite steep hills and variable weather. Efforts have been made to incorporate the bicycle into the transportation system. The
Three Rivers Heritage Trail
encompasses all the trails in the city.  The Eliza Furnace Trail, known locally as the "Jail Trail", stretches from Downtown (at the Allegheny County Jail) to the East End region, where trail access can be found along some roads. The North Shore Trail spans from the
Alcosan
plant along the Ohio River and continues along the Allegheny River to Millvale.  The Southside Trail follows the Monongahela River and beyond Baldwin Borough connects to McKeesport via the
Great Allegheny Passage
.  This trail, in connection with the
C&O Canal Trail
, forms a continuous motorist-free route from
Point State Park
in Pittsburgh to
Washington, D.C.
PAT has installed bike racks on all buses and it allows bikes on its subway/busway system at all times.
Healthy Ride
station
Bike Pittsburgh (BikePGH)
is the local bicycle advocacy group and is working to make Pittsburgh increasingly safe, accessible, and friendly to bicycle transportation. The non-profit
bike collective
,
Free Ride
, recycles bicycles and bike parts, teaches bicycle construction, and has programs to sell or earn a rebuilt bicycle. Additionally, bicycles can be borrowed at two places along the Heritage Trail through the
Friends of the Riverfront/Dasani Blue Bikes
program.
In 2014, the City began installing segregated bike lanes, which provide greater physical safety to the biker.
[
12
]
On September 6, bike lanes that stretch from Downtown Pittsburgh to the 16th Street Bridge on Penn Avenue were installed. In order to accommodate these bike lanes, the Westbound lane of Penn Avenue was removed, making it one way. Other segregated bike lanes were installed on Schenley Drive in Oakland, and Saline Street in Greenfield.
[

The "
Healthy Ride
"
bicycle-sharing system
entered service in Spring, 2016, supplied by
Nextbike
. Price is $2 per half-hour, or $12 or $20 per month.

Freight Railroads
[
edit
]
During the heyday of the steel industry, Pittsburgh was among the largest rail centers not only in the nation, but the world. For many years, the multiple rail crossings in the suburb of
Port Perry
at the mouth of
Turtle Creek
on the
Monongahela River
and adjacent to the
Edgar Thomson Works
and
Duquesne mills
, was the highest concentration of freight traffic in the world. Even today, with river traffic included, Port Perry is often very near or at the top of the list. The
Conway Yard
to the west of the city along the
Ohio River
was the largest rail yard in the world from 1956 until 1980.  From the beginning of the industrial era in America through its collapse in the 1980s, Pittsburgh was a key market for the nation's largest and most important railroads (most notably the
Pennsylvania Railroad
[the largest company in the world for much of the 20th century], and the
New York Central Railroad
[via the
Pittsburgh & Lake Erie
],
Baltimore and Ohio Railroad
and
Pittsburgh & West Virginia
). Despite the near-complete collapse of heavy industry in the Northeast, Pittsburgh remains an extremely important link in the nation's rail network.
Current railroads in Pittsburgh include:
Class I railroads
[
edit
]
Norfolk Southern (NS)
[
edit
]
Norfolk Southern
operates the former assets of
Conrail
, composed of the
Pennsylvania Railroad
, instrumental in the formation of modern Pittsburgh. NS operates three lines through Pittsburgh:
the original line, the
Pittsburgh Line
, from U.S. Steel's
Edgar Thomson Steel Mill
in Braddock, PA, over the Allegheny River near Downtown Pittsburgh, into Island Ave Yard where it becomes the
Fort Wayne Line
;
the
Mon Line
, along the south bank of the Monongahela River from
West Brownsville, PA
, to Island Ave Yard, formerly the Pittsburgh, Virginia and Charleston Railroad.  This line is used by coal trains from southern Pennsylvania and trains with
over-height cars
that cannot fit under the roof of Penn Station on the Pittsburgh Line, accessing it via a branch just east of Braddock to the
Port Perry bridge
. The Mon Line joins the Fort Wayne Line at Island Ave Yard after crossing the Ohio River on the
Ohio Connecting (OC) Railroad bridge
;
the
Conemaugh Line
, along the north shore of the Allegheny River, serving several coal branch lines and power plants. Operations are centered on a small yard in
Etna
, PA.
On the Mon and Pittsburgh lines over 60 trains a day pass through the city.
CSX
[
edit
]
CSX
operates the former
Baltimore and Ohio Railroad
(B&O) and the
Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad
(P&LE). Many of the old B&O lines have been removed or are unused. Formerly an important part of the B&O system, Glenwood Yard is leased and operated by the Allegheny Valley Railroad for local jobs. The yard used to give access to the B&O's
Grant Street Station
in Downtown Pittsburgh. The building has been rebuilt into a PNC Bank building and the old right-of-way is now a bike
path
. The B&O main line, which cuts north and under across Pittsburgh by the
Schenley Tunnel
, is now used by the AVR. The
33rd Street Railroad Bridge
over the Allegheny River is still used: AVR trains connect with Norfolk Southern's Pittsburgh Line about a mile east of Penn Station. CSX freight trains use the former P&LE through
McKeesport
, PA, and
Braddock
, PA, before crossing the Mononghela River into
Homestead
, PA. The P&LE line and the Mon Line run side by side until the Mon Line crosses the Ohio Connecting Railroad Bridge at
McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania
. On an average day, the P&LE line carries about 30–35 trains.
Class II railroads
[
edit
]
Wheeling & Lake Erie
[
edit
]
The
Wheeling & Lake Erie
is a regional railroad incorporated in 1990 after the
Norfolk and Western Railway
sold trackage from the original
Wheeling & Lake Erie Railroad
.
Wheeling and Lake Erie R.R.
Bessemer & Lake Erie
[

The
Bessemer & Lake Erie Railroad
runs north from the North Bessemer Yard in
Penn Hills
to
