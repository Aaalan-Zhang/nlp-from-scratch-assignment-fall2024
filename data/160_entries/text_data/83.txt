metropolitan area
surrounding the city of
Pittsburgh
in
Western Pennsylvania
, United States.
[

The region includes
Allegheny County
,  Pittsburgh's urban core county and economic hub, and seven adjacent
Pennsylvania
counties:
Armstrong
,
Beaver
,
Butler
,
Fayette
,
Lawrence
,
Washington
, and
Westmoreland
in Western Pennsylvania, which constitutes the
Pittsburgh, PA Metropolitan Statistical Area
MSA
as defined by the U.S.
Office of Management and Budget
.
[

]
As of the
2020 census
, the Greater Pittsburgh region had a population of over 2.37 million people. Pittsburgh, the region's core city, has a population of 302,971, the second-largest in the state after
Philadelphia

Garrett Nelson and Alasdair Rae's 2016 analysis of American commuter flows, "An Economic Geography of the United States: From Commutes to Megaregions", identified the Pittsburgh megaregion as a region encompassing the entirety or significant portions of 54 counties in
Western Pennsylvania
, Eastern
Ohio
, Northern
West Virginia
, and Western
Maryland
.
[
11
]
By this definition, the informal regional boundaries are similar to historical interpretations where the region is defined as the central portion of the
Allegheny Plateau
to the west and north of the
Allegheny Front
and south of
Lake Erie
and Pennsylvania's
Northern Tier
.
[
12
]
The hills and river valleys along the Upper
Ohio River
and its many eastern tributaries, including the
Allegheny
and
Monongahela
rivers have historically been the major centers of population of the region.
[
12
]
According to this research the US can be divided into 'mega regions' based on the most extreme commuting patterns within a geographical area (commutes within 100 miles from the core city). By this liberal definition, the Pittsburgh mega region consists of twenty-eight
Pennsylvania
counties (

The combined population of the megaregion was over 4.9 million in 2016.

There are also several formal definitions of Greater Pittsburgh which are often used in media mentions of the region. These include the
Office of Management and Budget
's Pittsburgh, PA Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) and
Pittsburgh-New Castle-Weirton, PA-OH-WV Combined Statistical Area
(CSA).
[
15
]
The
Nielsen Corporation
's
Pittsburgh Designated Market Area
(DMA) is another commonly used formal definition of the region.
[
16
]
There are nineteen counties included in at least one of these definitions and their combined population was over 2.9 million in 2016.

Historically, Pittsburgh has been grouped in the "
Rust Belt
";
[
17
]
however, reflective of the rebound of the region within the last generation, the metro area has been included as a part of the "
Great Lakes Basin
" gaining representation in the Great Lakes Metro Chamber Coalition.
[
18
]
[
19
]
Pittsburgh's association with the
Great Lakes region
is due in part to its economic, demographic and commuter connections to Great Lakes cities like
Cleveland
,
Erie
,
Toledo
and even
Detroit
.
[
20
]
Christopher Briem, an economist at the
University of Pittsburgh
's University Center for Social and Urban Research, has argued that southwestern Pennsylvania is "far more interconnected" with northeastern Ohio than it is with the eastern half of Pennsylvania, and that the industries of Pittsburgh are primarily linked to Ohioan cities such as
Youngstown
,
Akron
, and
Cleveland
, not to Pennsylvanian cities such as
Allentown
,
Scranton
, or
Philadelphia
.
[
21
]
He notes that, conversely, the population centers of northeastern Ohio are primarily connected with Pittsburgh and only secondarily connected to the state capital of
Columbus
. Briem argues that "In so many ways the state boundaries we think of as important are no more than lines on a map."
[
21
]
In recognizing their economic interdependence, Briem coined the term "Cleveburgh" to refer collectively to the cities of Cleveland and Pittsburgh, along with the smaller towns dotting the corridor of
I-76
between the cities.
[
21
]
[
22
]
[
23
]
Robert Lang and Arthur Nelson of the Metropolitan Institute at
Virginia Tech
also identify the region between Cleveland and Pittsburgh as being an interconnected "megapolitan area" and refer to it as the "Steel Corridor".

Culture
[
edit
]
Pittsburgh and its surrounding area has a distinct regional identity and has historically been regarded as a transitional region within the Northeastern United States. The region's counties also fall within the borders of
Appalachia
as defined by the
Appalachian Regional Commission
.
[
29
]
The City of
Pittsburgh
has been characterized as the "northern urban industrial anchor of Appalachia"
[
30
]
:
which makes it an anomaly compared to much of Appalachia which has traditionally been characterized as southern, rural, and economically distressed.
[
30
]
Joseph Scarpaci,
professor emeritus
of geography at
Virginia Tech
,
[
31
]
has described Pittsburgh as having "one foot in the East...and the other in the Midwest".
[
30
]
Barbara Johnstone
, professor of rhetoric and linguistics at
Carnegie Mellon University
, ascribes this isolation and idiosyncratic cultural identity of the region to the difficulty of moving through the
Allegheny Mountains
and the
Allegheny Plateau
.
The Pittsburgh area was sort of isolated. It was very hard to get back and forth across the mountains. There's always been a sense that Pittsburgh was kind of a place unto itself—not really southern, not really Midwestern, not really part of Pennsylvania. People just didn't move very much.
[
32
]
In his 2009 book,
The Paris of Appalachia
,
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
writer Brian O'Neill meditates on this aspect of Pittsburgh's regional and cultural ambiguity. The title of the book is intentionally provocative:
"The Paris of Appalachia" some have called Pittsburgh derisively, because it's still the largest city along this gorgeous mountain chain that needs a better press agent. I've long felt we should embrace that title, though few are with me. Several tried to talk me out of slapping it on the cover, but were we called "The Paris of the Rockies," we wouldn't run from it. Sometimes we're so afraid of what others think, we're afraid to say who we are. This city is not Midwestern. It's not East Coast. It's just Pittsburgh, and there's no place like it. That's both its blessing and its curse.

The Pittsburgh area served as a launchpad for the professionalization of both
American football
and
ice hockey
in the 1890s and 1900s. The first professional player (
William Heffelfinger
) played for a Pittsburgh football team in 1892, which was followed by the first open professional (
John Brallier
), the first all-professional team (the
Latrobe Athletic Association
), and a participant in the first all-professional league (the
Pittsburgh Stars
of the
first National Football League
). In the case of ice hockey, the
Western Pennsylvania Hockey League
was the first hockey league to pay its players in 1901, eventually merging into the first fully pro league, the
International Professional Hockey League
, in 1904. Professional hockey in Pennsylvania predated the professionalization of the game in Canada (where it eventually came to dominate in the early 20th century) by four years.
Today, the region is home to three major league franchises in baseball, football, and hockey; several minor league teams in soccer, baseball, and hockey; and three major NCAA universities.
